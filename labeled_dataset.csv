xfacu4,I miss my depressed gf,"My gf and i dated for 2 years. I met her in grade 11. She was in a different class but we were same shift. When i saw  her, it was love at first sight for me. She was good looking for me. I was kinda surprised that my friends didn’t find her beautiful. But that didn’t matter. So we started talking on instagram. We got really close. 1 month of talking and we are in a relationship. She  shared everything with me. One day she told me about her miserable past. She was sexually abused, not raped but touched by her father when she was a child. And at that point when she told me those things I fell in love even more. She told me she even attempted suicide after one of her really close cousin sister died. She asked me if i wanted to leave her because she was really depressed at that time. “Never” I replied. We promised to always stay together. And the relationship went well. We only used to meet in college because of course her parents were strict. We used to go out once a month barely. She told me she was the happiest when she is with me. I really felt like this is the girl i want to marry. Fast forward 1.5 years of relationship. She is a changed woman. She is way more happier than before. We still have a really good relationship even though we had some arguments. I was so proud of her and i often called her a strong woman. But the problem is she is a different woman. I still love her very much and she tells me the same. She now has a huge crush on some group of celebrities and was obsessed with them. I used to mess around with her making some trolls and memes of her “idol”. And in one normal day i sent her memes trolling her “idol”. She didn’t reply to me for 2 weeks. I thought it was lame reason to not talk to your bf so I didn’t message her for 2 weeks. When i did message her after 2 weeks, She tells me she wants to breakup. I was so shocked. Didn’t reply to her for 10 mins. Then i asked her why. She told me I didn’t value the love she  give me  and the most depressing thing she said to me was that she has been thinking of breaking up with me since 4 months. Yeah we agreed on the break up. 2-3 days later I really missed her and i beg her to sort things out.  She agreed but i felt it was forced love. It didn’t feel the same. I missed the old her. I cut her off. I was in grief. I remembered when i first met her when she was at her lowest. I looked back to the memories that i had with her and cried every night for 3 weeks. Then she messaged me in my phone telling me to unblock her. I did and had hope that she changed her mind because a part of me still loves her. But that wasn’t the propose. I don’t know what was but i felt like she was just playing around not wanting me to move on. And ofc i blocked her again. 2 months later  i have moved on but i don’t want to date any woman. I would rather go for arrange marriage in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xfacu4/i_miss_my_depressed_gf/,9/15/2022 22:45,66,0,70,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

I think there is a lot difference between being lonely and depression.Halka life ma sano obstacles ayo ki""la depression vayo malai"".

Being a teen myself I also feel the same way.I always used to think that my problems were original (I even strated writing book about it haha) such as :

1) girlfriend binai marni vaye

2)sathi haru sab nag xan

3)Family le kura bujdainan

4)Malai sab le bully garxa

1dfmu6z,A Guide for Those Who Are Depressed and Have Lost the Meaning and Will to Live,"Depression and tragedy often make us feel like nothing we do will change anything or is of importance. While conventional remedies like therapy, meditation, exercise and medications are frequently recommended, their impact remains limited without the right mindset. Restoring a positive outlook requires consistent efforts to reconnect with the elements that bring joy and meaning into our lives. Consider the following steps:

**1. Remember Hope**

Reflect on your younger self — a time when hopes, dreams, and determination were abundant. There must surely be a time when you had all those in you. Engage in a mental conversation with that spirited version of yourself, drawing strength from the dormant fire within yourself. Do this as many times as you need.

>“Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.” ― Cormac McCarthy

**2. Embrace Philosophies for Life — Absurdism and Stoicism**

While you may have personal philosophies that you live by, exploring Absurdism and Stoicism can offer valuable insights. I talk about these two particular philosophies because they are very relatable in our modern world.

Absurdism asserts the inherent lack of meaning in life. It suggests that the universe is indifferent and that human existence is ultimately irrational. According to absurdism, individuals can choose to embrace this lack of meaning and find freedom and happiness by creating their own purpose and values or they can choose to be sad and depressed.

Stoicism teaches us to focus on what can be controlled and accept what cannot be controlled. It emphasizes the importance of developing inner strength, resilience, and a calm mindset in the face of challenges and adversity and to live in accordance with nature. Both the philosophies complement each other.

>“Your personal philosophy is the greatest determining factor in how your life works out.” — Jim Rohn

**3. Seek & Embrace Inspiration & Connection**

Expand your horizons by reading biographies and watching documentaries of diverse individuals who inspire you. Strive to learn from notable figures across various fields, don’t limit yourself to just those who inspire you. Recognize that before becoming notable, before becoming great, their journey often included moments of loneliness and defeat, which they embraced and persevered through.

Or, simply connect with your loved ones or someone who understands. Talk with them to rediscover the connection that you’ve lost with life. Be mindful of their struggles as well and how they are pushing on. You might find some solace in knowing that you’re not alone in the struggle of life.

>“In everyone’s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.” ― Albert Schweitzer, Out of My Life and Thought

**4. Tame the Body to Tame the Mind**

Acknowledge the profound connection between physical and mental well-being. Often, we forget that our mental and physical states are interlinked. Be mindful of your breathing, dietary choices, and levels of physical activity. The easiest and the most basic thing we can start with is the breath. Whether you are already engaging in wellness practices or feeling too overwhelmed to start, consider trying out The Wim Hof Method, it’s a 10-minute breathing exercise. I recommend this method because it’s very basic and easy.

This technique, rooted in the centuries-old practice of yoga, can be initiated without delving into its broader aspects like cold therapy. You can find detailed instructions on the Wim Hof website.

>“When we start to tame the body and its needs, taming the mind becomes easier.” ― Om Swami, If Truth Be Told: A Monk’s Memoir

1c0j0s7,School recommendation for someone battling depression,"After I (21) moved abroad, I got to know that my brother (14) is struggling with mental health issues because of bullying from his friends as he has some stomach issues. He is typically shy and keeps to himself but these past few months have been difficult for my family to cope up with it as the concept of mental health is also new to them. He started therapy recently and has been doing better (would appreciate if someone could ref good children psychologists in Ktm)

He recently gave his BLE (Grade 8) exam and told everyone that it went well. I trust him because he is quite smart and likes reading books. He will soon go to Grade 9 but is struggling with depression and anxiety, especially around people and friends. He finds it incredibly difficult to make friends and socialize. At this stage, he's also going to go to Grade 9 and many schools don't prefer to take in new admissions. By a recommendation, we got him admitted to a local school but I don't really want him to attend it because of the quality of education offered there but my parents think it's best for him now as its closer to home. As I'm abroad, I can't really say much but they know I don't want him to attend the school and think its best if other alternatives are also tried out. 

So I want to ask people here, what would be the best action to take right now. I recommended taking a year off to engage him in some recreational schools so he can better deal with anxiety issues (School recommendations appreciated) but we don't really know how to proceed forward, any recommendations or help could change his life for the better.

The medicine dose seems to be pretty high in Nepal. She was taking 40mg medicines. Here that’s usually for schizophrenia or worst but she is just having normal depression not psychotic. 
Also she was going on and off with medicines like taking for few weeks and stopped for few weeks and again take medicines ( thats on her because she was telling me that sue forget to take medicine for few weeks as she is married and have kid). 


So i wanna ask if there are good doctors and therapist in Nepal for depression and also someone who first observe ls and then write medicine according to need. Also the therapist where she can visit weekly. She says that she need talk therapist.

pv6qz6,Posts about Depression and Suicidal thoughts,"I see a lot of posts about these issues pop up in this sub.

I really am the last person to have an expert opinion on this, but I  
see that a lot of you are hurting. I genuinely feel bad. I even met some of   
you in a meetup. What this experience told me was that, some of you need  
to have social contacts and good social ties to get out of the slump.

I don't mean all of you. Saying this advice applies to all of you would be  
harmful and idiotic. I mean some of you. Most of you say that you are   
awkward, introverted and shy. Maybe some of you are like that but not all of you.

See the thing is, some of you need to get out of the comfort zone and  
be an idiot, sound like an idiot and even look like an idiot. This world and  
the people in it will criticize you for everything. They will judge you for a moment  
and move to the next.

So, it's not worth thinking about the world. Go make mistakes, go create art,   
go make friends, go be an idiot. Go be  awkward in a group. I am sure  
some 4/5 people will accept you. There is atleast 30 million people in this   
country, by law of probability, there is atleast one group of friends that will like

It's usually at  around midnight. A dark figure walks toward my bed lay on top of me making me unable to move.( I literally see the thing when i'm awake otherwise i wake up with that thing on me). I could speak or shout, just cant move.  I can feel a furry body, i can feel breast on its furry body.  That thing stays for an hour or two and walk out , disappears into some corner.  i'd been to some local  shaman.  He said it's a kachibahi: they are people who died by suicide. They recommended not to  eat \*jutho, do some rituals.  for about 6 months, i seems to have effect. Now it's starting again. I know difference between sleep paralysis and other experience.  These type of things affect me a lot. Every time such event occurs, I cannot function properly the next day.  About a year back, i had such experience regularly and it  brought depression in me. Currently i'm on some medications .

It isnot  exactly my experience. It's an experience by a close friend explained to me. I'm sorry for writing it in first person. I feel like it is a better and easier way to explain. My personal theory is he has hallucinative schizophrenia.  I actually donot think  what he experience exactly happened. But i respect his experience, listened to him with keen interest.

vwmpxz,Depressed and Disappointed because cannot follow through on Immediate plans and goals.,"Made some cash through youtube, spend it recklessly and now that I m on my last bucks I regret it doing it, now i have finally decided to focus on learning Hacking but can't because semester exams are couple of weeks away, and I haven't classes as well ( my attendance is 1 or 2 days ), so now I have shift focus on exams, and I m also trying to get monetized on youtube again and having a hard time with it. 

So I plan on doing this, this and this but after a day or to I fall back into my same old habits of wasting my days with internet addiction and all sorts of addiction (like masterbation, Anime, Youtube, psychedelics, football, chess, table tennis, mobile legends, clash royal, cannibs and others) . I feel like I am over them but they come back to me in a seasonal way, some days I am addicted with this and I overcome it but after a day or two the next addiction kicks in. It's been like that ever since I was a kid. You guys can probably relate. 

I mean I just want to do start working, start learning but there is this resistance that defaults me back to enjoying my addiction. I mean I have force started to study or learn sometimes but it is not sustainable for me. 

And I have seen countless videos to solve this problem some with science backed advice and other religion or way of life related advice and tricks but I fail to apply them, somehow it doesn't work. 
 
So what do you do in this kind of situation?
How do you start taking action on a daily basis?
How do you make this ominous feeling go away without dwelling in addiction?
How can people be so ambitious, driven, and hardworking?
How can I be all of those things cause I feel like I m not making any progress at all?

My parents draw a monthly pension of 60k and we have house rental income of 30k. Debt free. Despite all this my brother is going through the tragedy of his life because he's not gone to ""bidesh"".  As a I went through college observing my brother's life, almost 80% of his friends are abroad. His girlfriend of 11 years broke up with him to settle for Canada PR wala guy. 

In few months he will be 31 and still struggling to find a suitable match. He's just normal looking normal guy and looking to get married with a normal girl. But before he even gets a chance to chat up with the girl, he is always rejected for not being in ""bidesh"". He might eventually get married. Even in every single social functions, gatherings and festivals, he is always confronted with the question of bidesh kaile jane? Nothing else matters. The fact that he's earning 90k per month also doesn't matter because people his age, the people he grew up tutoring and people he played with are now earning up to 10 times his income.

Now my brother is so depressed and always angry most of the time. His eyes in front of my parents and even me is always down as if he's caused a huge embarrassment for our family. Not only society, even he thinks of himself as loser.

h8xumg,Mental Depression: Help is just around the corner.,"One of my very close friend committed suicide when I was in first year college. We went to school together and when we passed out, I went to Delhi for further studies. He stayed in Birgunj for his study. After 3-4 months he hanged himself. I never knew he could do something like that. I didn't know much about mental depression at that time. I always used to think what could possibly be bothering him that he had to do something like that. What went wrong!. Why he didn't spoke to anyone what was bothering him! I was the closest one, where did I failed! All these questions are still unanswered. When I visited his home after few weeks, I couldn't face his mother. Felt like I was responsible somewhere. I wasn't there when he was going through all that. It was hard. The pain, the agony, the grief, it was extremely hard for me to move on from there. 
You know the hardest goodbyes are the ones that were never said. 
I am sorry I wasn't there 😔
I miss you!😭
May your soul Rest In Peace 🙏 Brother.

130ggtz,"A Rant: From Doc to Ditch, A Nepali Doctor's Frustration and Revaluating Medical Career","  

Today, I woke up and chose freaking frustration. Don’t mind me for I am about to rant my cerebral clutter in here. Should you care to join me, I invite you to follow along. I write this as a 32-year-old unattached female medical school and MBA graduate, currently jobless (not for lack of offers, mind you), surrounded by the chaos of a mind buzzing medical jargon, as evidenced by the 10 books and 3 screens open in front of me. I am curious… if there are any Nepali physicians who find solace in their jobs, financial standing, hospitals, or careers overall. Are you content with what the future holds for you? At 32 years old, I am disheartened by what lies ahead for me in Nepal. However, do not misconstrue my words, I love medicine with passion. I am drawn to its essence, love what this profession represents, and the potential I have as a skilled professional. Three years ago, I made a deliberate decision to return to Nepal for two reasons - I missed the familiar feeling of being at home, and my aging parents needed my support. Prior to the pandemic, I had a clear idea of what my future held; a six-month hiatus in Nepal, followed by further study or residency elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, the pandemic changed my plans, briefly compelling me to consider staying back in Nepal, tending to my parent's needs, and completing my residency here. However, that was not me. It was merely a lackadaisical ambition, which was a betrayal of the aspirations I had clung to for years, merely because the world was facing a pandemic. (Which, almost also killed me but that’s a depression for another day)

I had distanced myself so much from the outside world that I was not familiar with the workings of the medical education system in Nepal. As a result, I find myself in a difficult situation. I am required to take the CEE exam and it seems daunting now. As a doctor who also holds an MBA from an American university, I question why I must take this exam simply to obtain an “eligibility certificate” to leave the country for further studies. It appears that I will need to take this exam every time I want to pursue further education. Despite my efforts to understand more about this common exam, the Education Ministry informed me that regardless of my academic background, I must pass this exam if I want to pursue anything related to health. Otherwise, I will be barred from leaving the country. I also inquired about pursuing a Ph.D. or clinical research, which I am qualified for and have the support of my professor and a prestigious university in the USA, but the Ministry's requirements seem to be different. I am willing to take this exam, but why is it only conducted once a year, whereas several universities worldwide admit students four times a year? Is it fair to limit my ability to leave Nepal, or anyone else's, for that matter? Unfortunately, I never obtained the answers I needed, they don’t know why I need to take that exam but apparently, I do, and their phone number has been switched off for the last 3 hours. 

Why is medicine the most dreadful career path you can choose in a country like ours? I am not even referring to the way physicians are mistreated at hospitals and beyond. My nephew completed his bachelor's degree and earned a decent 150k a month! That \*&#\*$&\* Kid!!  He was still in school when I started on my medical journey. This salary is three to four times what I would earn if I were working or in residency in Nepal. I have dedicated a decade of my life, including the prime years of my twenties, to this profession, and I am not willing to give up on it solely due to the emotional burden it has imposed on me. I yearn for a solution without compromising my mental well-being. My family has never pressured me into anything, and I am capable of handling myself well if someone has anything negative to say about my recent choices, but I am frustrated and questioning the value of it all. Is the pursuit worth the reward? Is the return worth the investment? Are my sleepless nights,  antisocial and busy lifestyle worth what is to come in the next five years? Is there a Nepali physician who has questioned their decision to continue in this profession, or one who has bid it farewell with gladness?  


Should I just get my license elsewhere and skedaddle out of this godforsaken country!? And How?

Oh! Is anyone looking for an accountability partner for USMLE? Amidst my frustration?   


 TL;DR: Nepali doc frustrated with CEE, years of struggle, hates red tape, and is questioning the value of medicine. She's thinking of ditching it all or maybe taking the USMLE. Any takers?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/130ggtz/a_rant_from_doc_to_ditch_a_nepali_doctors/,4/27/2023 10:14,132,0,159,English,0,1,1,0,1,2
1hmv0d6,This mentality of my father.,"I come from a background where it is of utmost importance to own a fucking house in Kathmandu. But we dont. I have not lived long but in my 24 years of life, all I've heard from my father is ""Ekchoti sharebazaar badesi ghar banxa"". Nothing against him as he has supported me in every possible way. But, the sense of inferiority that I have to endure (while representing the family) because of relatives and my own grandma has reached its limits.

All 4 brothers of my father own house, and the irony is that no one can spare a room for their own mom. We take care of her, and all she does is nags my mom for not owning a house even after this long and my mom nags me. I have told dozens of time for my father to take a home loan, and close this matter but no just the same old ""aafnai paisa le banam"". I earn, our shop earns and we can absolutely afford EMI but still he is reluctant. We are always this close to owning a damn house and the economy fails us. My father has gone to depression I know of it, and me a miserable son cannot change his mind and share his burdens.

Because our goverment is corrupt. Government are not supporting youth. Youth hates nepal politics. There is corrupt politics in everything, everywhere. Youth doesn't want to stay in Nepal because they don't see their future. Some youth go to abroad after 12th. some stay to see their luck in their own country. There own friends who used to split their limited money in a hotel for snacks now one of the friend is sending lakhs in his home. And eventually, they will go to other countries to earn in dollars, euro etc. why because youth don't see their future in Nepal. Yeah maybe it needs time to be stable but we have only one life, we have a family to look after, we got a earn money, I love my country but patriotism don't feed.

1hg7en2,Feeling disgusted with myself,"
23M 
I am an average student. I dont seem to grasp things easily [ academically ] like my friends. This makes me wonder if I can become a competent doctor. 

Physically, I don't even like to look at myself. So many problems. I started going to the gym but then I had to stop after a muscle injury. I still have pain and whenever I try to lift weights, the pain aggravates. I lost around 2-3 kgs too. But now, I even hate to look at myself. I am nearly obese. Hate my face and body. Just everything. 

Mentally, I am better but I dont know. I'm afraid something may trigger me and I go back to severe depression. I tend to overthink a lot and get easily sad when people say something. Mentally, I'm weak. Sometimes I wonder, how will I live in the society if I keep acting like a kid, sulking if someone says something to me. 

I've ranted before and people suggested me to love myself. But I dont know what it means. I judge myself too much. 

Relationships failed. I have moved on. I tried to seek relationships too. Then, I moved to companionship from relationships. I was desperate to have a girl in my life. Now, I have moved on from that too. I think why would any woman like a incompetent unhealthy man? I've moved on it. I am above that now. I'm ready to live alone. I feel I can live alone with just myself.

16ksb9r,What was it?,"After 10 months of taking and giving time , she said to me you are not my type. When I asked her ,why didn't you tell me earlier rather than now when I am already attached to you? 
Here is a story:
She is my school friend. She used to be in relationship and she was in relationship for like 4 years. After her break up with her ex, started talking as a friend. The first 2 months was so normal I used to ignore her messages but after giving it a thought I thought maybe she is interested in me. So, we started talking everyday ,and also we did face time two times. I started feeling attached to her which was my fault.Maybe I found some one for the first time who actually cared for me. I clearly indicated after 3 and half months that I liked her. She told I also need to give it a thought and my response was normal take your time I can wait. She used to say me are you gonna leave me ...do you really like me ? I thought she needs more care, so, I was always there for her. I cared for someone more than anyone for the first time...I started getting more and more attached. And finally, she said I don't wanna talk to you, you are not my type. I didn't even get a chance to react. She just said me I tried my best but I can't do anything for you anymore. Now, I am here questioning myself where did I do wrong...going through some hard times.... can't even focus on anything. If I  failed to do well in college, my full scholarship will be revoked. I am depressed, anxious worried and crying all the times... I tried to talk to her , and she says don't make me feel guilt... it's my first time going through this phase.....I always focus on career and now I questioned myself of why it's hard for me to get some love.. everyone says ramraii padhaa ... career banau...Tara noone asks about emotional pain...i started hanging out with my other friends at my university but when I come to my dorm...the thoughts in my head hits me so hard....I can't even sleep properly.... it's getting more and more hard for me to cope.

ku1i9f,Findings/ Advice from a Nepali suddo,"Love reading the saturday tea talks and all other discussions on this thread. r/Nepal is awesome.

Anyways, posting some life advice as a middle aged user for all the bhai bahinis out there.

* Everyone's different. The sooner you realize it, the better. Took me a lot of time to accept it, tara thanks to my Mrs I realized that having strong opinions and expectations can cause too much stress. She's a very chill person who acknowledges without prejudice what other people think and I would argue with everyone on what I believed, she'd just ignore it. Took me 2 decades to get here but now I don't argue or think about it too much. Some people want lavish weddings and don't mind the loan, some want a cheap one. Some wouldn't mind spending entire life saving on a car, some would. I don't like kids, most people adore them. So yeah, everyone to their own.
* Life is short. Time yeti chitto bitchha ki pattai hunna. I know it sounds cliché tara do live everyday like it was your last. Doesn't mean party every day, but do the things that you wouldn't mind doing even if you didn't have to- do the things that don't cause you suffering.
* Bored hunu is ok, don't try to fill each minute with activity or productiveness. It's just too stressful. Young huda garne ho ekdum mehenat, ani pachi reap garne ho benefit- I get that. That's exactly what I did. Ani I did get where I wanted to reach but it caused so much stress all the way. I would've been more chill if I could do it again.
* Become richer, you'll be so much happier. Don't expect you'll get there by using your ancestors' properties', that's not how it works. You sad, be richer- you happier. You ugly, be richer, you prettier. No chick, be rich, you  chick. No hobbies, be richer, you hobbier. And the list goes on.
* Take photos. I used to be that cool guy in my teens who never took photos. wears black, listens to alternative, headbanger, long hair, knows his philosophers, reads, doesn't play sport- you know the kind. In a way I still am, Never had social media. But I did miss taking photos. No photos from my long hair days, no photos of old friends, of so many travels. The only ones I've got are the ones my wife's been taking since we started dating. I now enjoy it when google photos gives me that ""10 years ago today"" notification sometimes. Don't have to pose with a guitar on a stone in a river, anything that captures the day/event works.
* Drop inconvenience. Life's so simple, it's better to keep it that way. Long distance, Friend zoned, Stressful job, bigrine bike, adkine mobile, dukhne jutta, sex matra garna khojne BF, drinking habit, addictions, depression..... Sooner you sort it out the better.
* Grass is always greener on the other side. Jagir khayo, business gareko bhae hunthyo, paisa hunthyo. Business garyo, stress chha, jaagir khako bhae hunthyo. Bidesh gayo, aaera galti gariyo. Nepal mai basyo, Bidesh janu parya raichha. Bihe garyo, arki chai ramri thiyi, yo sanga ta kurai milena. It's a vicious cycle.
* Try and find happiness in what you have, if you don't think you can, change it. I read this book by Osho decades ago and it suggested that many people cling to their miseries because they are familiar with it or the hope of what's beyond the misery makes us endure the suffering of now. Don't be that person, drop it, change it or find you peace with it. The idea is something that's saved me so many times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/ku1i9f/findings_advice_from_a_nepali_suddo/,1/9/2021 22:54,401,0,65,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,0,0,1,0,1

105oad4,Help me understand what I saw today!,"okay, I am a skeptic, an atheist. I have never believed in the supernatural but I saw something today that has me confused. Let me walk you through the story. 

I have a friend who has suffered from a hysteria-like disease for some time now, well we are not sure if it's hysteria or not but she sometimes starts crying out of the blue for no reason and even faints. She has no depression or anything of that sort that we know of. For the longest time, we had no idea what to do but recently my parents contacted a dhami to try and help her. The dhami came today to my house at 9:00 AM and we called her. Before the ritual started she came into my room and we had a normal conversation she was acting the same way she has ever acted nothing out of the ordinary. Two minutes after the ritual I hear a loud crying sound one that I have heard many times as she often does so. As I head out I see her on her knees throwing stuff around making a weird sound like an animal. I was astonished, I have never seen something so bizarre IRL. As the ritual was carried out she started behaving more and more bizarrely, halfway through her hair covered her face and she shook her head like in that one scene from Bhool bhulaiya id be lying if I said it didn't freak me out.

I don't believe in the supernatural but this event has me questioning what is it. how is this possible, why does it happen the way it does?

Any input would be appreciated I am just trying to make sense of things.

10bmdfo,i will be sharing some details on sandip lamichhane case as some people don't know and some act like it didn't happen.,"For what happened there are 2 sides of story : the story is different from both sides. I will write in short here : the girl says sandip initiated from chat to meeting to going to kathmandu inn and then raped her. But sandip says it was girl who initiated and nothing happened that night. he says he just  slept in chair.

the case was filed by minor on sep 6 then arrest warrant was issued on sep 7. during this time sandeep was in trinidad and tobago to play twenty20. during this time CAN also suspended him. and sandeep made facebook post claiming he was innocent and would return to seek justice but disappeared. the police during this time claimed they had enough evidence to  prove that sandeep was guilty and had asked for a 12 year sentence. sandeep was refusing to return to nepal and nepal police asked for help with interpol to locate and arrest him on sept 26. only after this on oct 1 sandip announced that he would return on october 6. he or his lawyers said that he was on singapore fighting depression. later when he returned to nepal on oct 6, he was arrested. and some news also claimed he was not in singapore fighting depression like he claimed  but was in america(don't know if it is true or how they claimed it). 

so here's the  case if sandip was not in the wrong why didn't he return but nepal police had to ask for help from interpol on sep 26. only then on oct 1 did he said he would return and returned on oct 6. if nepal police didn't have enough proof they would not be just going around asking interpol to arrest someone. moreover a guy like sandip who is a sports superstar in nepal. and guess what  his lawyers aren't fighting to prove that he didn't rape her or had sex but the girl is not a minor. seriously? if he didn't had sex and the girl and the police didn't have anything to prove they had why the need to prove that girl was not a minor  for sandeep's faction. and there was even a fake video circulating the girl closing the door and people commenting afai dokha lagako chha khusi khusi, aja rape garyo vane arop lagauchha re. people are even badmouthing maiti nepal and anuradha koirala. how low can you guys go. mind you this is the majority of nepal. well what can you expect from people defending paul shah even though he himself claimed having sex and there was proof. 

as for the girl, it was previously told that she was seeking shelter in maiti nepal. and some people are even claiming that it is a conspiracy by the girl to get money or put sandip in jail. if it was about money the girl's side and sandip's side would have come to a compromise already. when sandip was not returning first step by his lawyer would have been to reach a compromise with the girl's side. as for girl's side making the case on their favour with power. you seriously believe a girl who is seeking shelter in maiti nepal has the power and influence to make a case on her favour against a sport superstar? do you take maiti nepal as a club where influential and powerful females gather? before sandip even returned to nepal, his lawyers were claiming the girl has 2 citizenships. and now are going all out to prove it. 

if it looks like shit, smells like shit, you don't need to taste it to know it is shit or not. you know it's a shit but to know more about the shit you might require other testing. so we are in this testing phase of this shit. sandeep and his lawyers know he fucked up. how bad  he fucked up only his lawyers and he knows it. and they will try hard to stretch the case and find a loophole to minimize the  damage as much as possible. 

so here's the both side of the story from girl and  sandip. source : onlinekhabar. 

The common denominator: Dev Khanal and Snapchat

The two, the survivor and Sandeep Lamichhane, met through cricketer Dev Khanal, as told to the police by both of them. Khanal had kept a photo with Lamichhane on [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/), a social media platform, after which the survivor sent Lamichhane a friend request. Lamichhane claims he did not accept it right away, but when he found that the survivor was Khanal’s friend, he accepted the request. Following that, the two started to talk sending photos and videos via Snapchat.

## Who initiated to meet?

The two kept on sharing snaps and messages for a few months, say both Sandeep Lamichhane and the survivor. But, when it comes to who asked to meet the other first is where there is a conflict between them.

Lamichhane told the police the survivor made the first initiation to meet as she was a huge fan of the cricketer. He says he told her he did not have time and would meet her after coming back to Nepal from the Kenya tour and the Caribbean Premier League in September. He claims the survivor asked to meet him repeatedly and said how she needed to talk about some personal things and needed his help. He said he met her, not wanting to disappoint her.

But, the survivor’s story is different. She says it was Sandeep Lamichhane who asked to meet before the cricketer’s flight. As per her statement, he told her as he would not be coming back to Nepal immediately after the Kenya tour, it would be great if they could meet one day before he was due to fly. As he insisted, she told Lamichhane that she would think about it.

The next day, she says got a call from Lamichhane before noon, telling her he would call her soon and it was not until 6:30 pm that she got a call from him, asking her to stand outside the parliament building in New Baneshwor. After she refused to go there, Lamichhane went to pick her up from Old Baneshwor at around 7 pm.

So, it is unclear as both their statements are conflicting regarding who wanted to meet whom. But, after they met, the real issue began.

## Drive to Nagarkot

Sandeep Lamichhane says the girl wanted to go to Nagarkot, but the girl says it was Lamichhane who had asked to go there despite her not wanting to go there.

Lamichhane claims the girl told him to go to Nagarkot as she was in the mood to go there. But, as he was due to fly to Kenya the next day, he refused. But, as he did not want to disappoint someone, he told her they could go but had to get back early. During the drive to Nagarkot, Lamichhane claims the girl told him she was 19 and that she studied in class 12.

Sandeep Lamichhane says he even asked her if her hostel would be open, adding it would be better if they ate something in Bhaktapur and went back. But, he claims the girl told him how she wanted to see the view of Kathmandu from Nagarkot and that Lamichhane should not worry about the hostel.

During the drive, he says they talked about the girl’s relationship with Dev Khanal, cricket and Lamichhane’s musical career. In Nagarkot, they went to Boginee Resort, where they spent a few hours talking, singing and eating. He says he even pulled out his guitar and sang along with the girl. He says the girl even put her head on his shoulders, which made him uncomfortable and asked her if she wanted to return. It was 11 by the time they left Nagarkot.

But, the girl says she was taken to Nagarkot without her will and Sandeep Lamichhane even enquired about booking a VIP room at the resort. He even asked her if she wanted to drink alcohol, to which she said no, along with telling him she could not stay in Nagarkot as she had to attend classes the next morning.

## The fateful night

The survivor says Sandeep Lamichhane booked only one room at Kathmandu Inn, but she asked him to book two. When they reached the hotel, Lamichhane asked the survivor to put on a mask and gave his mask to her and asked her to get the keys from the reception and go to the room. They even changed a room as the AC was not working in the one they got. She says he asked her to not sleep with clothes on too, but she refused and slept with her clothes on.

She says she dozed off and when she woke up, Lamichhane was next to her, naked. He pulled her pants down and was raping her. She was in shock, but as she was physically pinned down, she could not do anything as she says Lamichhane’s semen was all over her abdomen. She says he raped her again a few hours later and when she tried to protest, he hit her on the back. Shocked and afraid, she could not do anything as he abused her.

In the morning, she says Sandeep Lamichhane dropped her at her hostel.

Lamichhane’s version is different. He says they had to take a room at Kathmandu Inn because the survivor told him she could not go to the hostel as it would be closed. Shocked at what she said, he told her he had to be at the hotel with the cricket team and asked her to come there with him. But, she refused as everyone would be there including Khanal. Then, Sandeep Lamichhane proposed to take her to Kathmandu Inn and book two rooms, but she did not let him do so, he says, telling him she was afraid.

In the statement, he says they did not share a bed as he sat on the chair talking. He wanted to go, but she told him to stay and leave in the morning. He says they talked about her parents’ divorce, sponsoring her studies and her life. He even sang songs to refresh her mood. He says he slept on the chair and woke up at 6 and left telling her he would be busy as he had to concentrate on his game.

When he was accused of raping the girl who told him she was 19, Sandeep Lamichhane says he was shocked.

###                 

&#x200B;

yes there are still many unknown things about the case. just look at the statements made by sandip : from the victim asking to meet repeatedly, girl putting her head on his shoulder  making him uncomfortable, survivor telling she could not go back to her hostel as it would be closed so he was forced to book a room + the girl refused to go with sandip on cricket team's hostel, then they went to the hotel and sandip wanted to leave but the girl asked him to stay and leave in the morning. then sandeep and the girl chatted and also they didnot share a bed so sandip sat on chair. he even sang songs to refresh her mood. man what a nice guy. imagine how many girls dream of having a guy like this. then he slept at chair woke up at 6 am then left saying he would be busy he had to concentrate on body.

even if sandip had not done anything wrong. from how he acted, to his statement, to how his lawyers have moved the case forward tells something happened and snadip fucked up. how bad he fucked up and if he is wrong or right only he knows. all we can do is make conclusions on what they have shownn us from both the sides. there are some vedas who were defending sandip from day 1 without even anything on the case. and majority of nepali will support sandip even if he had raped or had sex with minor. here we are minority on reddit who talked against paul and are talking against sandip. though on sandip's case it has not been clear what happened but from what he have been shown sandip did something wrong. so we are on the victim's side for now. yesterday some of us were making fun of sandip saying he was on depression. we should not be making fun of depression but people have been using this as an excuse: good examples are prithvi malla, pramita rana.

i2uxrd,Am I alone in not wanting to have children?,"Got into a heated argument with my parents about why I don't want to have children. They called me selfish for robbing them of being grandparents.lol.  I've never had a brooding feeling. I've seen too many  stressed out mums, seen disappointed parents with their kids and vice versa. They're a financial burden,  and don't forget stress inducing. I barely manage to look after myself and don't want to take more responsibility in looking after another- shouldn't that be enough to justify why I don't want children of my own. 

 Note to add: my parents are very supportive  and understanding with my struggles with mental health  but with topic of children and marriage, they can be infuriating .  

Edit: I am 30F and not living in nepal. Financially Independent( thus far ). Currently single. Been engaged once before, it all got cancelled  because the guy couldn't handle my depressive lows and he wanted children. Please do not bash him, I don't blame him but we were not compatible .end of.

Sounds like a biodata for marriage. XD

P.s I don't know how to make round roti or selroti.

For those that have reached out to me on dms regretting bringing children into this world, I wish you all well. Hate to say it, but you brought them into this world so take full responsibility and try not to ruin your child's life.

 I am really fed up of this monotonous  life abroad and my parents are getting older.

124o44x,My family falling apart,"
I have noone to share these things with so i am sharing here to unburden myself of these thoughts. 
Idk my family is falling apart day by day. I think everyone is going to suffer alot incoming days. My father business is going down everyday thanks to lockdown and global recession we are barely surviving on rental income. My mother is schizophrenic depressed since my birth. I had the most difficult childhood due to my parents being emotionally unavailable. My dad being busy scaling his business whereas my mom being depressed and lying on bed all day long. My two sisters are unmarried and there is societal pressure to our parents to get them married. However One is applying for PhD in india and one is going for japan. One of my sister is unemployed for now instead of completing her mba and with 3 yrs experience in accounting and sales. One of the shocking things i found out about her is she is too suffering from depression. I came to find most shocking thing is because she was the only one whom i thought is stronger in our family but seeing her like this breaks me apart. My other sister also had difficult childhood and is insecure and was suicidal few years ago to the point she overdosed herself. I myself was hospitalised for overdosing myself exactly one year back. Seeing my family like this breaks me apart. Apart from my father, all four are patients of depression. Idk i am afraid, if only one of us commits suicide, there will be cycle of suicide until noone is alive. And let me tell you, we are generationally wealthy i guess net worth around 8 crore but still none of us are happy. I blame my mother for most part. All she did throughout my childhood is to feed me just thattt. Never looked after me and my siblings or supported my father but i still can't blame her, she had her own issues with mental problems. Also if my motherside of my family wasn't there with me and my siblings, we would have been dead or on streets by now. My father stayed with my mother just because he was getting financial support from my mother side. As a result, we three siblings has to suffer. I sometimes wish they never married eachother. We are barely making through. My parents did have sacrificed alot though at the same time i am not saying they havent but I can't help but say they have failed as parents all throughout and still haven't been able to do anything for my family so the biggest loser is me. I am not at the condition mentally to move abroad but I want to. I have joined college but i am self studying at home. My parents are forcing me to go to India but i know life won't be any better there. If i get Scholarship i will go there for most part but for the most part, I know my life is over. No hope left just abyss and abyss. I am suicidal and i am afraid if i take the first step. Other four are going to follow the same path",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/124o44x/my_family_falling_apart/,3/28/2023 13:04,74,0,54,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1ew0hz4,Extreme Hair Policies: Chopping Away at Student Mental Health,"I had cut my long hair before the first day of my highschool which i was growing for over 8 months, I was just as excited as anyone to start a newlife and that was it, I was stopped at the gate and was asked what kind of person i was for having such hair (8 cm long hairs) and was kicked out on firstday. Second day, I went school after trimming my hair and was kicked again, asked to call my parents and force to cut my hair more shorter. I was depressed and Till now im insecure. And my confidence is now shattered in pieces.

I don't know if this post is gonna make any difference, But If you are someone who can relate, Let's raise voice, Because Nepal's obsession with uniform conformity is taking a toll on our students. Rigid hair policies are not only outdated but also harmful. Let's prioritize individuality and self-expression.

He is bedridden. He can only move his right hand himself. We have spent most of the money for his medications. Even though the financial situation's not as bad as it could be, im tired of waking up everyday to know i have to keep watch over him. Clean him, change his diapers. Feed him. Im tired. This has affected my personal relationship as well. I dont even feel aroused by the male body. Im tired of this. There isn't even anything i can do. 
I got exams soon but i cant focus. I just want to lie down all day. I should be thankful we don't have to lose our shelter yet. I know i should be thankful for the things I have now despite all this. But i keep comparing to how it was like before and how it is now. I am tired. I haven't told anyone about my father except one guy who was my bf. It's not even a big deal to say it out but i just cant tell my friends. I cant do it. honestly better to not let them know but sometimes it's just too much. N i get sad. Im not depressed. I think i have handled it pretty well. But some days, something inside me gets triggered and it bursts out in immense sadness n frustration.

1f5c4os,Overcome Addiction of any kind- you are not alone,"Overcoming addiction without direct medical assistance is a challenging but achievable goal, especially if you have a strong support system, a clear plan, and the determination to succeed. Below are some practical steps to help manage addiction on your own, backed by research and evidence-based strategies.

1. **Acknowledge and Accept the Problem**
   - **Step:** Begin by honestly acknowledging your addiction and accepting that it's a problem that needs to be addressed.
   - **Research:** Studies show that self-recognition is crucial in the process of change. The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change emphasizes that the first stage, ""precontemplation to contemplation,"" involves recognizing the need for change .

### 2. **Set Clear, Achievable Goals**
   - **Step:** Define what success looks like for you—whether it’s complete abstinence or gradual reduction. Set small, achievable goals.
   - **Research:** Goal-setting theory suggests that specific and challenging goals lead to higher performance and motivation .

### 3. **Identify and Avoid Triggers**
   - **Step:** Identify the people, places, and situations that trigger cravings or the urge to use. Avoid these triggers as much as possible.
   - **Research:** Behavioral models of addiction stress the importance of understanding and avoiding triggers to prevent relapse .

### 4. **Develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms**
   - **Step:** Replace addictive behaviors with healthier activities such as exercise, hobbies, or creative outlets.
   - **Research:** Engaging in regular physical activity can reduce substance use and cravings by enhancing mood and reducing stress .

### 5. **Use Mindfulness and Meditation**
   - **Step:** Practice mindfulness, meditation, or deep-breathing exercises to manage cravings and stress.
   - **Research:** Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to significantly reduce substance use and cravings by promoting self-awareness and emotional regulation .

   - **Research:** Gradual reduction methods can be effective, especially when combined with behavioral strategies, as they allow the body to adjust slowly and reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms .

### 12. **Plan for Relapse Prevention**
   - **Step:** Develop a plan to deal with potential relapses, including identifying warning signs and having strategies in place to get back on track quickly.

We grew up during the period of life, when internet was just starting out.. and when I think about this... it feels  like a fairytale. That moment of relief when you get to enjoy the video game after long awaited hours for electricity was something nothing could beat off. Exchanging casettes with friends, games CD/DVD was common culture at our place. Socializing with people was never a problem... outdoor games ruled all our childhood. Marbles, catching हिले माछा  in ghar ko nala. Playing badminton with neighbours even though you don't have to worry about breaking the ""ice"" lol. I still remember my mum she used to make me scream ""renuka darling I love you"" to our nearby neighbour.  There was never a dull moment when it came interacting with people.  Then internet happened, it started to change everything very slowly. I realized, next year marks a decade of completion  SLC. I am still sticked with my studies, just to distract myself... don't really bother socializing with people as long as someone breaks the ice... I miss my childhood buddies. They have grown up too.. but it doesn't feel same with them anymore. Everyone is consumed by their own life... we barely talk with each other... maybe its just a part of growing up.. i don't know why I am writing about this.. but man those pre-internet era were the time of our life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/yzp7lz/people_born_in_19961998_whats_up_with_life/,11/19/2022 23:26,35,0,59,English and Nepali,0,0,1,1,0,0

Those kids that went to college everyday had got like 4 backs ani I was able to do well going to college 2,3 days a week and studying at home. First sem ma I went to college nearly everyday but since I had absolutely 0 friends and this was my first time literally having 0 fuckin friends I just didn't know how to cope and stopped going to college. Yk looking at the window or looking at your phone all the time, sitting in a corner and not knowing what to do. No one talks to me and I do approach people, last time I approached someone heck that girl said it straight to me, ""timi sanga boleko haina kina reply gareko, timi chup basa aau *a girls name* jaam"".

So I pulled out tyo celebrity in the class/quiet kid that rarely comes to college wala persona xD.
This is kasto draining ani I'm taking a break from everything now. Literally no social medias at all. I just downloaded reddit to rant. I'm not talking to anyone I knew before entering this college too. I'm just not talking and avoiding everything. My mental health has been terrible ani my battle with depression is not sth new.

And life went on and forgot about it. 
Ani after few months today I am realizing that what ever business I am trying is not working out for me. And today I was having couple of drinks and out of no were this thing hit me. 
Is it even a chance that the reason I am not having success in anything or not being able to determine my future path is due to not being able to complete that bhaakal. Because I remember I out spoke That “help me, fix my thing  XYZ god and I will do ABC for you” and IDk it worked. 

I probably said that ma 100 ota laddu chadauxu to one of the god “maybe kuldebta” or bishnu or ganesh. I am not sure. I remember calling out their name. Sound depressed but I did that.

And if you believe its true tell me how to complete my bhaakal even its for peace of my mind. 
I am an atheist but this is bothering me. I am having some weird dreams as well. I being drowened in a gutter ( Naali), being chased by some animal, and some other weird stuff.

1gskugu,"""How Should I Explain That Everyone Has Different Personalities?"" ","

The way I behave with my family, especially my father, is completely different from how I act around others. For example, I usually don’t talk much with my dad because I feel nervous around him. And when it comes to people I barely know, I don’t feel like talking to them either. I only really talk to people who share similar interests with me. Because of that, I don’t have any friends to talk to right now.

My dad thinks this is a big problem and that it might lead to depression or loneliness. He tells me, “You don’t talk happily with me, you don’t talk to others, and you have no friends.” I get why he’s worried. I do talk to my classmates, but only when we’re in class. After that, there’s no connection. I never try to reach out to them, not even on weekends.

It’s been 1 year and 3 months since I started taking panic attack pills, and my dad thinks this behavior could make things worse. But what he doesn’t know is that I don’t actually feel lonely, even without friends. classmates are also unaware that I have a social media account, so they can’t contact me—and honestly, I don’t want to contact them either.

Another thing he’s really worried about is my gaming. My parents think that playing mobile games is the reason I might end up depressed. But isn’t playing games a normal hobby? I don’t feel like it’s causing me any harm.

What can I say to my dad to help him understand that I’m okay and that he doesn’t need to worry so much?

This has affected my workplace so much that the staff (around 1400+) in my company are facing delayed salaries. As of Jestha, we haven't gotten paid since the month of Poush (6th month running without pay). The director of the office has promised to pay and keep only 2 months of the back log from the coming fiscal year, i.e. Shrawan. I think it's still unfair. This is causing stress and depression to us profoundly.

Are other companies in Nepal also having this intensity of financial crisis?

1fmx4a1,Is it okay to Not be okay?,"This is for men.

Is it okay to not be okay? Is it okay to feel terrible? Is it okay to feel bad without knowing why? Is it okay to struggle with understanding what’s going on within yourself? Is it okay to be unable to express how you feel because you’re scared of being judged, worried that others might see you as weak?

Is it okay to feel depressed about where life is taking you? To think about the things you believe you should do to feel better, yet be afraid to take those steps? Sometimes, it feels daunting to consider how friends and family will react if they find out what you’re going through. I may desperately need someone to talk to, but I feel lost when it comes to expressing my thoughts and emotions.

The voices in my head may seem to grow louder each day, amplifying my fears about the future. I wonder if I’ll ever find my way or if I’m capable of achieving anything at all. Despite my efforts to keep it together, I feel like I’m losing myself more with each passing day.

I know I’m supposed to believe in the process and push through, but when my energy is depleted, that becomes an uphill battle. It feels like hiding my struggles is no longer an option, yet the fear of others’ opinions holds me back.

It’s time to acknowledge that it’s okay to not be okay. My feelings matter, and I don’t have to navigate this journey alone.

19dqmag,Turned 20 today and I'm disappointed with my social life so far,"When I look back at my teenage years, I feel like I've missed out on so much in life. Spent most of it locking myself in my room playing meaningless video games and browsing you know what on incognito tabs. As such I never got to experience what it's like to properly socialise with people, and hence I was always a social outcast, a pushover to every person I met, never had any relationships (a thing that bit me for the most part), and an absolute bore of a human being. All I ever had was temporary relations with people which too felt conditional and forced at times. The only good thing I had was a family who took care of me and always looked out for me, but then again I recall the fact that I was often rude to them and pretty much pushed them aside to overcome my own insecurities. 

And now I sit here, entering a new phase of my life but still with a clouded mind and uncertainty in where I go from here. I've made a bit of a headway by completely cutting off porn, and reducing the time I spend on video games, but it's not really helping, in fact I feel more depressed than I did before.

11jp4j4,What do you think contributed to kids and adults being civil in Holi in the modern times?,"When we were young in grade 3 or 4 as I recall, Holi was a street war. Guys painting their face, noone was safe from lola(water baloon) attacks. Some slum kids also used to pee in those lolas but we never did it. We were civilized kids, we only used clean water in our lola. Maby occasionally dirty muddy water for texture, but never pee.

I remember an incident that I am not proud of when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, perhaps I was around 8 or 9 years of age. I and about 4 other friends were hiding, waiting in our usual ambush point, ready to attack people with our lolas and whatnot. A lone girl who looked no older than 25 was walking in a nice dress. When she approached near us, we sprung into attack mode, we threw a bunch of lolas all around her and ran away, she was wet and colourful all around her torso. Who cares she did not want to play Holi, it was Holi of our time and if you walk in the battlefield, you will get ambushed. I am not proud of what we did but we were only kids.

For the past decade or so, this kind of activity has completely disappeared. I dont remember when was the last time I saw someone facepaint. These years, I only see kids playing in their own groups, more like hide and seek and lola hit. For some reason, Holi is never the same. Is this a good thing? For the most part, yes. But again, why so sudden change? Why now? Most of us who were warrior kids are depressed redditors now but that does not mean the world has less supply of kids to fill in our position now. I am atleast happy to announce noone's sister will have a bad day because some kids ambushed her anymore.

1c99eir,Comparison is a thief of joy,"Infact, it is a thief of your motivation, hardworking, discipline,,mental peace, etc etc the list is long
Everybody has their own life, own journey, own struggles, the sooner you realize that your journey is yours,  it's unique to you, you'll have your own idea of struggles and happiness, and own path.
Just because your friends had it easy  doesn't mean you are supposed to have it easy too.
So why compare and ruin your own mood and life?

Instead of accepting the fact that, world is indeed unfair and non of the people's  lives are same, you wanna be depress all day comparing your life with others?

1go56kr,Life and feelings towards,"

I am 19 year old (M) have always wanted to feel how it's liked to be loved to be cared and to have feelings like other. I was the you youngest among the 2 siblings in my family and I never felt the emotions other children felt towards their parents they would go around and tell my dad is a hero I like to be like my dad I love my mother but I would be there flabbergasted beacuse all the father who used to pick their children up from schools would be happy smile carry them in shoulders while mine talked to me in a angry manner and take to a restaurant buy me one plate of momo and then say in loud voice eat fast I need to teach tution and after I eat he tell me to go home and I would go alone from nursery and in home my mother was a teacher too and my siblings would go to study so I would be alone at home. Time passed by and I slowly grew up i became a kind of kid who used to obey their parents at any cost so when they told me to go to hostel even though I didn't wanted I simply agreed even tho I went on hostel I was simply home sick and felt sad my grades started dropping 

I was bullied for being a teaches son and not scoring adequately being a kind person in hostel didn't helped to everyone used to pick on me. I just missed my parents I wanted to be close to them I wanted them to say that they are proud of me I wanted them to feel proud beacuse of me and I wanted them to express it verbally but that never happened. From class 5 to 10 I was in hostel in holidays even when I come home there where always arguments and fights between my mother and father and although I came home my mother used to shout at me that I lost this and that and I felt no better when I reached I'm class seven I wanted to leave the hostel I didn't wanted to be there.

 I build up my courage and told my mom she said she will take me out of the hostel if I get good grades but my grades where dropping as soon as I was there so I read and read and got 65% to which my mom replied either stay here ro go to ur village to plow fields no other options so I was forced again repeating the same stories I reach to class 10 and I was happy to go home I signed my shirt and drew pictures but as soon as I came back home my mother stood me up and shouted me for hours for losting some things and I was devasted. 

Later my see results came in I wanted to get A like my siblings but instead I got a B+ and I was a little sad but instead of getting praised I was met with it's ur fault u should have read harder aaile mukh fulayera vo and evertime there was minor inconvenience she used it bring it up. And I continue my grade 11 I was sad weak and depressed nothing I ever did impressed them or make them feel proud and I felt in that manner so I started to go to gym to cope with this burden I lifted and lifted I focused on my self became a good looking person and met a person who I loved and had feelings for she made me feel something I never felt before and she cared about me listened to my problem gave me a shoulder to cry and said it's gunna be fine and I loved her we used to hang out in my house all the time cus I used to be alone and I had a mini store I used to work all day clean the house dishes and do homework then make tea for my mom when she comes from work and then take some money for bus fee and run to the gym but 


unfortunately my father found us hanging out tougethere twice and he told to my mom and she told some un speakable things to me but yet we didn't give up I gave her hope and said it's gunna be fine and carried on now she is at 11 and I passed 12 planning to go aborad. I only feel like this for her and I don't know why I can't feel positive for them. I have matured and grown and become a confident person and I feel like I have been a good and faithful son but I just don't wanna let her go because my family dis agrees there are things I haven't included cus the story would be long but the point I am trying to say is am I wrong for not feeling this am I bad for having a choice am I not trustworthy even tho I have figured many things out by my self this has kept me in choke hold beacuse I don't feel the same way I feel about her to my parents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1go56kr/life_and_feelings_towards/,11/10/2024 17:00,2,0,0,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

For about two years I was on medication and it really helped  and I didn't experience any anxiety attacks until recently. A few days ago, I watched a video of someone sharing their suicide attempt on facebook  which triggered my anxiety after all these years. For several minutes, I struggled to breathe but went back to normal again after sometime.
However, since that day I have been struggling with anxiety again and it has been overwhelming me with fears for no reason. I've been trying to distract myself with hobbies or even keeping myself busy and connecting with my family members but no its not helping.  So I keep wondering if I should maybe go back to see a psychiatrist and  if there's a way to heal and regain that sense of stability I once had. Any help would be appreciated.

And not knowing what has happened to me was really frustrating. I used go to bathroom and cry, tried very hard to fix me but was unable to do so.

After +2 i took one year of gap because I knew that this thing inside me and studies cannot go together.Before joining the Bachelor i made a agreement with my mind that it will not bother until I finish my studies then after it can do whatever it feel like(so foolish of me).

Fast forward to covid I suffered real bad,told my family.Visited couple of psychologists still i was not fine.Then i visited Psychiatrist who identified that i have an anxiety but didn’t prescribed any meds.Perhaps suggested yoga and meditation.And after 3 months i ask OK.

But i again suffered recently and had some few setbacks.While browsing i found about  Dr.Claire Weekes and her book                  “HOPE AND HELP YOUR NERVES”. Ohh god how can someone understands anxiety so well.She is a life saviour, she will show you love, she will treat you as a warrior rather than coward.

m3erw9,Let's talk about lockdown and pandemic induced anxiety. Upvote for maximum visibility.,"So, our university has already started for about two weeks. I was talking with my classmates... and I was suprised to hear that so many of them had spells of anxiety, depression and full blown panic attack during the lockdown. I thought I was the only one. It's like most of the classmates are anxious mess. Some complained about feeling of impending doom and death. So many of them had physical symptoms like palpitations, difficult breathing, chest pain etc.

So, I have been having the same issue since November and was recently cleared by cardiologists and GPs since there was nothing wrong physically. Had an echo, ekg, chest X-ray and blood test,  and nothing pointed to anything serious.  I was asked to consult a psychiatrist. I was prescribed anxiety medicine  by a cardiologists to lower my pulse rate which can reach 130s  when i am anxious. , it was 98 when one of the doc measured it after the tests and blood pressure was perfect 120/80.

But I am not going to take that anxiety medicine it unless my psych says it will be necessary(Has seen nasty effects of these medicines in some of my relatives). Thankfully all of the tests and consulation was free for me because of the uni insurance policy for the students.

Also, I was asking around my classmates and friends about these stuff and couple of guys even had the same tests as mine.

So what I gathered from these interactions is so many people had mental issues during lockdown and the pandemic.

v13mwn,is alcohol a medicine for social anxiety disorder? and is this hungover?,"so i got drunk. properly, for the first time in a party. i have had alcohol before & got somewhat drunk as well, but forcefully with a frowned face. gosh, do they taste bitter. but i tried wine for the first time and i can see myself drinking that. i just kept drinking and after 5-6 glass. i got really drunk i really had to coordinate my muscles to walk. it felt like i was on a one sec lag. i could barely make out the words when people were talking to me in the background noise. but i still has capacity for reasoning. tho one particular thing i realized was that. i had no negative emotions. i tried thinking about my insecurities and stuff and still nothing. only happiness, lol! haven't felt like that in a long time. i was also showing abnormal behaviour, for eg i was just walking around the crowd with a smirk in my face, and i was just bobbing my head to the song, in public. lol! i don usually do any of those. they tried to made me dance but yeah i didn't. so still no introverted code broken here. that was a weird feeling, a nice feeling. it made bad emotions disappear and good emotions stayed for some reasons. is it how it is? not just that day i have very little social anxiety since then. may be it's cause of the exposure then the alcohol but still it seems to have done wonders to my social anxiety.

but the next day, i felt okay hai but after the eve i felt so bad. the next next day, i had night fall and was continuously horny for hours after waking up then it pendulated between horny and sad untill i went to gym. and i felt really good after i had the blood pumping up. felt really good throughout the 2.5 hours of HIIT. now i am not sure how hungover works. is it a hungover or something unrelated?

Tldr: a serendipitous encounter with alcohol. that seem to have changed how i feel. and is the 2nd paragraph a example of hungover?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/v13mwn/is_alcohol_a_medicine_for_social_anxiety_disorder/,5/30/2022 16:12,5,0,7,English,0,0,1,1,0,1

ha3223,Reflecting back on a bad breakup and anxiety a year later,"Last year I broke up with someone I loved dearly. This was a sudden but a forthcoming break up. This was an end to a 3 years of living together relationship. I was devastated. I was made the left out guy in our circle. Avoided and left out by people who I thought were friends. I came to know who  my true friends were. I went through shit had anxiety attacks, woke up and wept in the middle of night, blamed my self for everything and was just feeling really low. Thanks to my ""new"" roommate and a few friends for being there for me and pulling me out of that.  Now a year  later my ex is engaged to some guy in a different country. She changed me like her college. NO hard feeling towards her, Karma is a bitch thats all I have to say to her. I have actually realized what family  and friends means in life and most importantly realized what I am and who I am. I feel better than ever now, am doing good professionally and personally. This all experience has made me to be more caring, kind, humble and hard working. 

For all who are going through tough times. I just wanted to say that you will overcome this and come out stronger and wiser than ever. We shall overcome!!

I lost my Dad last year. He struggled a lot in his life mentally and financially but always gave me the best upbringing possible. I am doing good career-wise, all thanks to his and my Mom’s sacrifices and guidance. Just when things were looking right for us and I was in a condition to help clear out our mortgage so that my parents could enjoy their days peacefully, my Dad sadly passed away. That was last year. I then left for foreign to continue my work. This year, after some serious consideration and a very anxious trip, arrived here to check on my Mother and spend time with her. Did 14 days of absolute self quarantine and social distance but when i went out for a walk, to my disbelief, the buses in Ktm are so packed, so much so that folks have to stand up just like in normal times. I see temples have long lines. Taxis don’t have protective cover between the driver and passengers. Not everyone is wearing mask. Every shops and offices are open. Schools are reopening. To add to that, these friggin relatives coming at our house in random. Mask ta lauchan, but aaye pachi chiya khanchan, baschan, ke ke tauko na puchar ko guff, usle yesto garyo, tesle yesto garyo, usko bihe bhayo, and tesko baccha bhayo. All the usual Nepali guff gaff. On the other hand, I am an extremely anxious type of person, unfortunately :( This is one thing i don’t like about myself. When i was in foreign, I just went out to do grocery. Tyo pani manche thorai hune time ma milayera. No seeing friends, no social life, absolute work from home for almost a year now, no real human interaction outside of my immediate family there. That’s why, I am so fucking afraid something will happen to my Mother especially during this covid 19 situation. So much so i wear mask all the time inside the house. I get these panic attacks the moment i lay down at night where i am
absolutely alone with my thoughts. I had a bit of stuffy nose for less than an hour. I was so stressed that I had to tell my mother to not come anywhere near me. I worry for her, constantly. I just cannot control my anxiety. Been trying meditation. Will 100% seek therapy soon. Anyone feeling anything like this with even slightest bit of similarity?

The habitat loss for these animals over the previous century is terrifying. No wonder people were afraid that many would go extinct. Some did went extinct and after public awareness and massive conservation effort some are bouncing back from getting close to extinction. But these conservation areas looks very small to me. And still humans are encroaching. Major projects and highways and railway cutting through this habitat. In such small area just a highway can have huge impact. Just gives me anxiety. Just hoping that humans in future will make concentrated big settlement which are efficient and green as well. and leave other lands for the animals. For settlement humans dont really need much they need quite some land for farming and grazing but if we make the system efficient  we can leave in harmony with the other species. Of course we without being aware conquered everyland build small village in every hill.  It will be impractical to do this large level of migration but in far future in another century might happen.

Aaja bihana, ma office jaanu agadi inDrive book gare as usual. Driver ko call aayo saying waha location ma 5mins ma pugnu huncha. He took about 15 minutes to reach. Cool, sometimes thaau thaha hunna k hunna I didn't really make a fuss about it. Tara, he was in a different vehicle than what was in the application. 

Yo kura aachkaal seemingly normal bhaye ni, I personally don't condone it. Ke bhaiyalyo bhane trace kasari garnu? Here's how the conversation went and I'm not making anything up:  


Me: Dai bike chai arkai lyaaunu bhayeko ho?

Me: Ae, agadi text ma bhannu bhayeko hunthyo ni ta  
Him: Tapai lai jaanu cha ki chaina?

Him: Ahile samma kasailai problem bhayeko chaina tapai lai chai kina hora?  
Me: Haina dai maile tapai le agadi kina bhannu nabhayeko bhanera matrai sodheko ho, safety ko pani kura aaucha.  
Him: Tapai lai location thaha cha ki map herne?  
Me: Ekaichin dai ma bike ko number plate ko chai picture liyera ghar ma pathaauchu

Then all hell broke lose. He started telling me ki ma waha lai attitude dekhairakheko chhu ani said ki maile waha ko video liye jaba ki malai waha ko number plate ko picture liyeko thye. Maile waha lai, police bolaum pani bhane because at the point, I am a woman and a grown man is yelling at me with no chance of me speaking! Hera i'm not even trying to play the woman card haina tara its scary when a man is yelling mero legs were shaking I was having full-blown anxiety. 

Tyespachi that dai started recording me. Maile dai lai, dai I have a lot respect for you esto nagarnu bhanda, he said something like angreji ma nabolnu sabai le bolne bhasha ma bolnu k k. Malai arko kura yo jabarjasti classism project gareko mannai pardaina. he said aru stuff lai tapai haru lai lagcha ki hami indrive garne gareeb or something like dude, quit projecting!

Aba mero prime concern. Indrive ma, my name, location and address is exposed. What if, he shows up with a bunch of people? Where is the f-ing security? Ani, is coming up in a new ride an acceptable thing now and I should've just sit quietly and let things roll?

I have rated the guy 1 star tara indrive ofc does nothing. Ma k garnu? I don't wanna name and shame because personally I feel we all have bad days and what if this is his only source of income that I might potentially deprive him of? Idk man I just hated this interaction overall and don't feel safe using inDrive anymore.

1fgt86d,From Darkness to Hope: My 22nd Birthday,"Today, I turn 22. Normally, I’m not a big fan of birthdays, but today feels different. The past two years have been the darkest period of my life. I’ve spent so much of it isolated, confined to my room, battling thoughts I never imagined I’d face. There were days when I didn’t think I’d make it through, but somehow, I survived.

I won’t lie it’s been incredibly hard. Loneliness, anxiety, self-doubt—they all took their toll. But today, on my birthday, I’m choosing to hope. To hope for better days in all aspects—academically, mentally, emotionally. I want to grow into a version of myself that I can be proud of.

This birthday is a reminder of resilience, of getting through what seemed impossible. I’m still here, still fighting, and that’s something I’m learning to celebrate. So here’s to turning 22, to new beginnings, and to finding light after darkness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fgt86d/from_darkness_to_hope_my_22nd_birthday/,9/14/2024 18:59,45,0,45,English,0,0,1,1,1,1

10vyvlr,Not nepali but I need advice,"I am portuguese woman I'm dating a nepalese man. Honestly one of the best thing happening to me. Even my family adores him very much. 

Now going to the point, in December we are planning going to Nepal to attend one of his best friend's weeding, the thing is I have no idea what a woman should wear in a nepali weeding. My boyfriend says that anything is fine but I'm so afraid of disrespect his friends.

I am tall (168cm), pale skin and kinda busty and sometimes it catches attention from foreing people. I have no attention of catching attention because I feel anxiety and also I have no intention to do so because that day is not about me, is about his best friend and his bride.

Anyway, what colors, type of dresses or patterns are appropriate for a nepali weeding? Here the no no are white (because the bride's wear white), black (because it's associated with funerals) and floral patterns (don't know the reason of that). I'm aware that in south Asia the bride's attire might be red so I will also avoid that color.

Any recommendations or should I buy the traditional saree when I arrive in Nepal?


Also I'm going to meet his father. He seems like a cool person and he raised my boyfriend very well but I don't wanna make things awkward or disrespect him in any way. I wanna offer him some gift. What nepali in laws like to receive as a gift?

I feel terrible when it comes to talking/ meeting new people. Especially, when people are kinda above my family standard(in terms of class).

Just yesterday I went to an anniversary party with my father.

At first,I thought that it was a normal get together types party but later got to know that it was a grand celebration in a hotel.

I was dressed normal; blue jeans, white full t-shirt and slippers.

Everyone else in the party were dressed formal.

Seeing all that, I was terrified to even look at people. I felt I was walking, starring weirdly. Also, my left leg was shaking like never before.

In addition, today I was invited at a wedding. I was completely free to go but I didn't. I myself made excuses of not having formal clothes, too hot to go outside and so on. 

I feel the same everytime I have to go out of my house. Even, when I'm going to my college  which is just 5km away from my house; I feel fear traveling alone in a bus to the college.

1bgcjon,This life only gave me a pain..,"As an introverted  girl who had health issues and gained a lot of weight because of medicine, I was bullied for my whole school life, be it classmates and teachers. They probably didn't know, but their so-called joke slowly killed me. The humiliation I went through when my teacher threw my homework copy only but passed it to everyone by hand. He pretended like he was in a rush to go outside in between class. I wouldn't have been bothered if he did it once, but he constantly humiliated me for half a year doing this. The gasp I would hear come out of the boys mouth was so humiliating. 
That one new teacher would constantly ask if I'm 80 kg so loudly. To this day, their laugh still keep ringing in my ear. I was around 60-65 kg with 5'2 ""height  bcos of medication. Now, I'm underweight with 5'6 height thanks to the constant bullying.

The second long life trauma happened because of a family dispute. My sister-in-law constantly harassed my family for money only to get a divorce in the end. It put us on so much debt cos we were paying for her scooter and training course. The constant fighting ruined my mental health. No 18 year cld focus on anything, seeing her family crumbling deephole. 
[
I will skip the details of the family dispute as it's more dramatic than any TV serial] 

We were already in so much debt, and I wanted to study Bsc. Nursing, but I had to give up on my dream because of financial problems. The last straw for me was getting sexually harassed while going to college during winter. I ran like a mad-woman, and the man was running after me while mastuburating. The fear i gained of public places and the hallucination of every man was after me to harass is scary. The survivor anxiety killed me for real. I didn't tell anyone because I knew if the news passed to my village, I'll be ruined for life. I can't even keep eye contact with any man till now. I had to drop out of college bcos no matter what, I cldnt focus on my studies. 

Working in the field helped me to calm myself. I focused on handling mom's shop and growing crops and vegetables. Now, I want to continue my studies at 26, but I'm scared.

1dytiwh,How to cope with a father that demotivates you?,"Context: I am an MBBS doctor in nepal. My father has severe anxiety disorder. Especially regarding my future and studies. 
I tried convincing him to go to a psychiatrist and take medication but he's in denial & refuses to acknowledge there's anything wrong with him. 
When I'm studying or working to achieve my goals, he constantly texts me sth or comes to my room & says sth that demotivates me. 
He shows his anxiety & makes it quite clear that he has no faith in me. He constantly brings up my past deeds & makes me feel bad about it. He's never proud of what I've done till now. He says/does things that make me lose my focus.
I feel I won't be able to make it in life if he keeps on dragging me down this way.
I can't get out of this house because I don't earn enough yet.
I'm in the kind of profession that takes time & extreme focus to compete & make it big.
& since my father constantly disrupts my mental peace; whenever I'm working towards a goal, he drags me down & it takes some time for me to recover & get back in form. As soon as I get back in flow, he again says/does something that again disrupts my focus & mental peace.

q5cmen,Thoughts on spending large amount of money on weddings,"Recently I saw a post on this sub-reddit asking estimated cost of marriage in Nepal. Personally, I feel that weddings in our country is more for the relatives rather than the couple themselves. We spend so much money to host the wedding, invite relatives that we barely know and by the end of it both bride and groom are exhausted to even enjoy their own wedding.

I would prefer to have a small function with close friends and family only. We could use our hard earned money for other things that would actually make us happy. Maybe get that dream car we always wanted or go to our favorite destination.

I know that there are people who actually want to have a large wedding and it's great if it's what they want for themselves. Honestly, it would be too anxiety inducing for me. I wish that we could have our own version of dream wedding without worrying about what others will say.

1dductn,I feel like i messed up suggesting my friend to keep his phone to himself.,"

I had one of the exams but my roll number was nowhere to be found(TU stuffs) and the same thing happened to one of my classmates so I asked him to sit with me as the last bench of last row( out of three) was vacant and we got there as he was approaching to put his phone somewhere else but I asked him not to do so coz I felt no one's gonna check it as I also had my phone before the day with me in the exam and I faced no problem, also I thought he did not bring his bag so why to bother giving it to others while we can just simply put it to ourselves just by silencing the phone(our college used to allow us to keep the phone to ourselves but by silencing it and we were not allowed to use them, yes I know it sounds weird but this is how it works here as we all know). Some external teacher came to check the class as we saw him I quickly asked him to keep my phone under the desk and he did, but he kept his phone to himself(idk why) even tho we knew if the teacher knew we had a phone it would put us in the trouble. The teacher came and checked all of the other students he also found some of them using cheats and took their papers too. Now it was our turn, he came and asked him what's there in his pocket(as it was visibly inflated due to phone) he said it is a phone and teacher took his paper as well. Till then we were just fine coz we thought that even if he gonna fail he only fail or get expelled for that particular exam but no he was fully expelled not just for theory but for practicals too, he had no result for the final exam, it just says expelled. I didn't ask him to find his result. I was just randomly putting some of the symbol numbers in the site to see my friend's result and I eventually found out his too.
Mind you it was our final exams for the year.
I got the result and I also checked for his result but it showed that he was expelled. I m feeling so freaking guilty about the thing and having a lot of anxiety I m being so restless and blaming myself for the incident. I could only think why did I ask him to keep his phone to himself.
Can you please tell me if I am guilty enough of this?

And i cannot afford to go for another round of check up because of time limitations. and   i cannot manage other things with the studies at the same time. Maybe because of my anxiety i am feeling more intense ,i cannot keep my mind still. I am planning to go for test after exam although i cannot study too. What should i do to keep my mind busy in study through exam time.???? Tbh i am not that unwell i can do everything but the weird feeling in the area that i have problem in ,is freaking me out😑",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/16agaj8/just_wanted_to_share/,9/5/2023 6:22,13,0,29,English,1,0,1,0,0,2
18e8n0h,Is it even existential crisis or am I pathetic and lame??,"So yeah, what does an average lowish middle class dude has to say on a platform like reddit with such pessimistic kind of title written. 

Okay it's my first time really expressing my problem with which i've been surrounded for like forever and that's social anxiety. Oops! that's way too normal problem for  a teenager, right? Or maybe not!! (Btw I'm 17 and I do go college to just hate myself for whatever shit reasons). So let me give a kind of nobody cares backstory to put some things into more focus which I'm going to talk about. Well I was a not too shy child around the age of up to 11-12 ig. So I also had lots of lots of transfer of my living place because I used to live in rent I guess. So as a kid I was a bright kid with the glare in his eyes (Maybe bit made up lol) to conquer the world, achieve everything and be the king of the society in terms of fame and that superiority with the amount of success and achievement which is still my incentive to grow a bit, but as I turn into adult I find that I've grown a complicated problem of social anxiety which is not normal imo! 

Okay let me cut it short 'cause I think I'm way too good at writing bs. So, I think it was during grade 2  when I had a transfer to a new school because finally we built our own small home in a bit faraway place from my original place where I used to live in rent. And this was completely new place for me and probably not too favorable as it was bit modern and flashy in some sense, so I never really adapted to the new environment and school as properly as one should do. I never really had that close friend or a true circle where I felt I belonged. I had friends along the way but I never truly connected to anyone and btw my interactions with female was less to nothing from just grade 6 and it's the same way. Call me a weirdo and shit but I think that lack of one male friend or group of male friends had just caused my confidence to be gone as it was always impossible for me to hold conversations alone with a girl but to make things were they were also groupies and could never get into such group conversation thing. I grew distant from any sorts of social interaction as I only was good to hold conversations with some sort of close male friends and not anyone else. When that one bit close friend too left me due to some father's new job thing, I was clueless with anything going around me. I haven't contacted him in forever as I was not that close ever with him as well. 

Damn I write a lot and it's 'cause like it's my only form of expression of my character in years. Please read it all from now if you had time and composure to read all this thing up to now. So yeah in short and simple terms its probably autism but now comes the most traumatizing problem of mine.... Social media addiction and wrong use of internet  for most of the time. It was just after my friend left me that I had luxury of using Wi-Fi for the first time when I was like 14-15. So I got into pop culture and  anime all Internet memes and shits. Then, I stopped giving damn about my best chance to do something in life which was academic excellence that I possessed. My study was ruined but still I managed a quite decent A grade in SEE which doesn't show my academic potential in all honesty 'Cause I was built up as 4 GPA guy before of course my introduction to Internet. So due to this growing influence of pop culture on me, I slowly stopped caring about normal middle class people with less Internet addiction and less fanciness as I was devoured by the pop culture influence and superiority and pretentiousness. I almost had audacity to hate or find people boring who supported me to learn some basic social skill.   

Now the retrospective phase of my life or redemption arc has begun where the miserable life of mine with no social life gets worse!! Yes I actually think it gets worse. All these things I had realized 3-4 months ago after getting into college and getting look of disdain from people. As my original people in school used to look me with kindness as they knew of my problem and treated me okayish despite my inner hate or superiority towards them cause maybe they thought I was just shy which I am but the problem was larger. After that, I tried improving as I abandoned Internet but then I realized I had lost everything friends( as for them I was good shy person),  family (again the fake superiority and low middle class thought of their), sense of reality, fashion, caring for yourself and Everything. Even some poorer (no disrespect) people around me were more proper and good looking as they used to bath and do some stuffs to look good which I stopped caring about as I didn't even see myself in mirror and compare this version of myself to older but focus on other and over think with all force of my not so good mind filled up with shits. The way I lost myself is incredible and now I realized why people look me with incredible disdain. 

Now all I think about is fulfilling basic life principles and learning to live as social being with good mental space. But thing's just I'm too filled up in mind with shits to comprehend about my next step in life and I feel stuck in loop of atrocious self hate and which I wanna avoid. I need to build from nothing as I have practically nothing along with being broke as my father's prime is long gone to earn livelihood for us. I want to build good family environment, be good son, a good husband (seems impossible with current state) and all but more importantly good human. Am I naive or am I just born miserable? As a kid I had male fantasy of spending time of my life with girl I like. But now just building an eye contact to woman is win. The condition of my every aspect in life is minus infinity in my head so I need to start from scratch ig. I wanna live, earn, prosper build relationship and again conquer the world in a way but things just fall apart as I know how difficult life is now. 

It's probably the worst put words, sentences and paragraph anyone in this sub ever read but please if you read so far, identify my problem or anything to suggest me or motivate me and help to make me believe again. I know its dumb and kinda emo but believe me my experience is not as simple as it which looks from my words. Any comment positive or negative or any words of wisdom might help me is what I thought.


TL;DR:  I am bad at this but basically for those who wanna extract some basic theme of my post, does loneliness and social media or internet addiction really affect your life in a way that you become non-existential in the actual world and make you fall so deep down that there's no way to make comeback to win in the things that actually matter in life to make you happy in realest sense?

1d0q1am,Stroke is debilitating to our Physical and Social function.,"When I revisited my home after about 5 months I came to know that one of my neighbor had stroke. He was a fit individual who would work in the field tirelessly and could live up to 100 years from the way he used to do things. But 4 months back he had stroke because of which his left side was completely paralyzed. Currently he is just able to walk and is doing physiotherapy daily to improve his walking. The amount of disappointment he had in his face was saddening to me. He once was very active and outgoing. Now, he is just sad and keeps on repeating that he could do many things and now can't even walk without his family support. 

The thing is that he used to have blood pressure in the range of 150 mmhg. We used to advise him to take hypertensive medications but he used to say that he will control it by doing exercise only. He never listened to us So, I just wanted to inform you guys to keep checking your blood pressure and your family members. If you have high blood pressure then you should start medication with proper counselling from the doctor. All the best guys and take care of your health.

pqqbpl,Dying young,"I'm 21.

Head hurts. Asked my mom for a sitamol and had to listen about how I'm fragile and have to consume sitamol at this age. Where did it all go wrong? How did a happy, outgoing kid turn into the person I am?

&#x200B;

Am currently on the chaath writing this. Been carrying this paranoia with me for some time and thought I would share them with someone. Not gonna go into details, but I'm afraid that I'll die young. I get paranoid over small things. Something as small as a minor headache or muscle pain. 

&#x200B;

 I am very young and I don't want to die this early. I've yet to experience life and all the good and bad stuff that comes with it. Things like being in a relationship, being intimate with someone you love(considering my definition of intimacy), travelling, living alone, working, meeting new people and countless other things. I want to experience these things before I vanish off of this earth. I'm afraid that I won't be able to because I'm gonna die early.

&#x200B;

Not to self diagnose,  but I don't think this has anything to do with depression or things of that sort. I'm happy and content with my life for the most parts. This paranoia sets in my brain every other day or so. Sometimes I think I've truly accepted the inevitability of death and the fact that I can do nothing about it and just should enjoy life instead of pondering on about my fear of death. I feel happy most of the time.

&#x200B;

I would like to die when I'm in my 50's or older. I've yet to learn and feel a lot of things that comes with life. I want to make my parents proud, go abroad, pursue my interest in physics, help people that are in need of help. Sadly, I think death is gonna ruin it all for me. 

&#x200B;

In this moment as I've finished writing this alone on the chaath I feel at peace. Why can't life always this peaceful? 

&#x200B;

I wish all of humanity the absolute best and hope good for everyone. I hope you all live a long , prosperous and most importantly happy life.

&#x200B;

This stuff was originally written in  my diary and I had to cut all the personal bits and references. I'm not ill and neither am I suffering from any kind of life threatening disease. I just am afraid that I'm gonna die young. Whenever I get a headache or minor chest pain I think it's cancer or some other life threatening disease and keep thinking about how I'm gonna die. 

I want to leave you all with this beautiful song from Mogwai named Cody.

pv4dr0,[Serious] I cried at my workplace twice,"So I joined this one of the well-known IT companies through the internship. I had been self-learning for about 8 months. I got selected with ease and they put me on a project.

This is where I noticed something peculiar. The project consists of some handful juniors only with only one senior. At first it was difficult, this was my first time working on a professional environment and only senior we had didn't help on any aspect of the project.

After few weeks I caught covid and took 2 weeks leave. When I came back they put me in mobile development. I was not familiar with application development in any way. But since nobody was around I had to accept and took it as a learning opportunity.

This is where it started getting really bad. Since I was learning and working at the same time, I wasn't as productive as I would have been in web development. Then suddenly this senior called me and started asking different things about mobile development. I answered what I could and what I knew. But this guy jumped on me like a hungry prey. He started telling me things like ""How did you come this far without knowing these things?, ""Did you cheat on the internship?"", ""I will give a bad review on your review now so you better be careful"", he went and went and went on for 10-15 minutes straight and wouldn't let me speak, I broke and cried, this was the first time.

He even complained to my project manager saying ""I wasn't serious"", ""I am incompetent"" and all, I tried explaining my situation to my PM but to him, I was probably making excuses only. 

Second time was similar but worse, he asked me something related to the work other guy had been doing, naturally, I couldn't answer and I asked a few minutes but that triggered him so badly that this time he made me do a video call and started yelling at me,  I couldn't hold this time and cried on the call, 

I'm not sure if I am being a snowflake but is this something I have to bear my whole career? It got so bad that I stopped sleeping because if I sleep, the morning will come early and I have to go back to work to face same senior again. The notification sound of slack triggered anxiety on me, I was constantly alert and on fear at same time. I am one of the most jolly person you can find (like seriously, I am that guy who laugh super loud even at smallest of things) but I haven't smiled for a while now, I was thinking about quitting but what about my family? we aren't poor but my father was only earner and I am big help to him right now and I feel like I will let him down, but at the same time I dont want my mental health to get fucked in the process either.

You know the funny thing is, this senior applied to internship twice and couldn't make it, he joined another company and that company send him back to this company (idk how this works)

TLDR; cried because of an asshole senior, dont know if I cried easily and dont know if I have to face this for rest of my career",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/pv4dr0/serious_i_cried_at_my_workplace_twice/,9/25/2021 10:42,77,0,52,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

1fco606,Being in Endless loop: Running away from situation,"M23 I am always complaining about the life situations that I have faced.Most of them might not have faced such situations.We are struggling to keep up the businsses, pretty much loans and installments needed to pay for, rent,fooding and other expenses.We own the shop but we have just been guarding up the shop.We have previous installments that we need to pay from other merchants. Tô add up new inventory needed alot of investment.The thing is that we are not able to run up the business.We are merely earning for  place to live to eat food and to pay up the rent of shop.We donot have fund if one gets ill .

I was facing the pressure from my early engineering journey.Courses were tight scheduled and I didnt want to look after classes.The assignments I used to copy from my friends at very last hour.My neglienece towards the study has kept in this situation having backs of 25+ subjects.I have filled up the forms for all subjects and gave most of them of odd semester.We donot own a house nor have  stable income.Despite of this factor I didnt do the job hoping I would be aid for the business and do some study.No it didnt happen,I just scroll down the phone on shop all day long .And I wouldnot study after the long day off.This phenomenon was continued for 3 months until I had my exams.

During exam season as I was not prepared for the subjects.I began to procastinate,I didnt study.I jus scroll down social media,binge eating and PMO.This cycle continues until this day.

I began to feel like I am hitting an axe on my own leg .I am the one responsible for the situation.

Why am I struck in this endless loop??

Seeing the lives of my friends who are doing well in Nepal as well as abroad.I felt like  why I am struck in this situation.I find no one to share this.I have made FRIENDs which I am not able to share about my situation as they are more financially stable,live happy life along with their family.I have not met any friends in this 6 months interval.

I am just chasing down the dopamine leaving all the important tasks that I meant to do.That study,job ,that research .... I began to live in a life with full of anxiety,stressful situations where I find no way to get out of this crap...

PS: Deleting social didnt help me as I was back  to short feeds from Youtube and Tiktok content.When I start to study after 10 min I am scrolling down internet.Although I have blocked thembut  I just unblocked them and watch all day long.After this post I might be able to focus for an hour but after I am on same path...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fco606/being_in_endless_loop_running_away_from_situation/,9/9/2024 12:25,4,0,1,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

17yu5l6,Why Nepalese eat Nepali food abroad?,"We say our homemade is more tasty and healthier than those Nepalese restaurants but still many Nepalese go whether they are in Europe or some other parts of the world.

It's not the same as like Chinese also go to Chinese restaurant when they are abroad or Japanese go to Japanese restaurant when they are in Europe. The vast difference is that their average restaurant food is actually more better or same level as their homemade food, whereas of ours, quality of Most Nepalese restaurant food does not surpass the authentic taste of our homemade food, perhaps in every household, if not, in most Nepalese household.

So why do most Nepalese go to eat Nepali food at Nepalese restaurant when they already know the taste won't be that good than their own homemade? 

Because of the Environment? The vibe? (So you just want to be in the box or the anxiety occurs if you eat at some other national eateries?)

Or to support our Nepali business abroad? (Dumb thoughts? Why do you want to support when you already know the quality and service isn't any better? Or the food isn't any tastier than your homemade)

It's not like only on occasions or festivals or celebrations but regularly Nepalese go to Nepalese restaurants.

All your life when you live abroad, you go to eat Nepalese food than where you have been living the most. When Nepalese live in Germany, they go to Nepalese restaurants than the German restaurant or others. Same as in China or elsewhere.

Last time I went to Nepalese concert overseas and there was food stalls from different country but only Nepalese food stalls had a huge queue, youngsters were even complaining loud like Momo was so bad, selroti was too oily and burnt. People in the line even heard them, literally most of them already knew it was bad but still they lined up and ate that bad food despite knowing how it already was. The other food stalls were empty, I was having a delicious Spanish food nearby. Nepalese staff at Spanish food stall smiled and gave a very nice customer service whereas in Nepalese food stall, staff were rushing, not giving a damn care but just to give food quickly and grabbing the money. This really wouldn't happen at International festivals or concerts.

But my real question is why do you or Nepalese if abroad go to eat Nepali food at Nepalese restaurants Most of the time when you already know the taste won't be as good as your homemade food that you have been eating all the time? The alternatives are anxiety for you?

19fdedj,Is our parents thinking or mentality still backward to talk about their child's trauma and mental health???,"I'm 21F and this is the story of my friend who was constantly harassed and raped by her own cousin when she was only 12 years old. She didn't knew what was happening to her and she froze during that moment. She confronted about her childhood trauma just a month ago to me, after that we were mature now. It is very common for girls to get harassed at least one time in their lifetime, for example, bad touching in public transportation and all. I have also faced these kind of harassment when I was a kid and I didn't had any knowledge about bad touch. I couldn't sleep all night thinking about the incident of my friend, how bad it harmed her self confidence, she stills get anxiety attacks thinking about it.   
I told about this incident of the friend to my mom, thinking that she would console me and I would feel better, but she took it so lightly and thought it like a taboo. She told, "" usle afno mom lai kina nabhaneko, dherai sojho bhaye pachi estai ho."" Also there was my brother in other room, she told me to talk in small voice so that he won't get to hear all of this. I was so shocked by her response, and honestly her response was totally unexpected to me. Also my friend couldn't get the courage to share all of this incident to her mom, because our parents never provided us the environment to share our feelings to them in general. They love us to the death, but they never understand about their child's mental health and the lifelong trauma they give due to their actions. 

  
All I wanted to ask is, Is our parents' thinking or mentality still backward when it comes to discussing their child's trauma and mental health?   In my case, NO!  If I try to share what's bothering me or talk about my trauma, they will probably say that I'm overreacting. They don't even understand the concept of a depressed person, they would just label that person as 'pagal' or mentally retarded.

1c2sv78,Doubtfulness regarding sinus medicine,"Backstory: i had sinus and extremely dry eye from as far as i remember. So if i ever had headache its always either of the two.

So, about some months ago 2023 august, i had continuous headache for a week. so i went to check my eyes and they prescribed me glasses with 0.25 power. i wore it for 6 months before rechecking and they took me off glasses but through the whole time my headache bhane didnt get better much.

And for that i thought maybe something is acc wrong in my head and i went to get head checked in a good hospital ( wont mention name ig).

&#x200B;

*WHAT THEY ASKED ME*

They asked me if i had anxiety ( i do have but akdammm kaile kai anxious hunxu natra im chill)

They also inquired if i got stress ( halka fulka ta jaslai nih hunxa but ma teti stress lini manxey haina, only little stress i have is k gani bhanera attinxu, just that)

So, its kinda clear that my headache isnt cause i take tooo much stress, or have crippling anxiety, nor depression, cause i dont have them.

mpp0zc,Arranged marriages and its effect on mental health,"Hi everyone,

Hope you're all doing well.

I've gotten to an age where talks have now started on finding a girl for me for arranged marriage and man.... it's completely destroying me.

Background info - I'm 28 and have lived in a western country for 21 years, but am very much Nepali at heart. I grew up here, studied here, and have a nice career here. Ever since I was young it was drilled into me that I need to marry a Nepali girl, and that's very much what's been in the back of my mind ever since I was a kid. I didn't date anyone growing up as I always knew that eventually I'd have to go through the arranged marriage process.

Anywho, all these talks about marriage officially kicked off a couple of months ago and I knew going into it that the whole arranged marriage process wasn't going to be easy and that I would come across a lot of hiccups and whatnot.

I'd say maybe 40-50 girls have been 'proposed' to me, and out of them all I've only really liked one or two. Things with one of them went a bit further than with all the others. We texted for a month or two and even met each other, but I could tell that she wasn't into the idea of getting married. So when the time came for a decision, obviously she said no (which I was expecting).

For some messed up reason though, I've been a complete mess since then. Is it because this is the first time I've had to deal with a rejection (despite anticipating it)? I try to move on and brace myself up for the next girl, but damn I keep on thinking about this girl. Things have gone to shits since then (this happened a couple of weeks ago), and it's now affecting my day-to-day life in the form of an anxiety attack. I've started questioning my self-value/self-worth, and really everything negative in my life is now being spotlighted. I've sought help from a counsellor to help me deal with these emotions, but yeah obviously it's hard to relate to a westerner who wouldn't necessarily understand these types of things. 

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere where there's some anonymity, and hopefully also find that there are others like me who may be in the same boat? Any of you guys, or girls, that have gone through similar experiences? Doesn't matter if you live in Nepal or anywhere else, would love to hear your stories and how you dealt with your issues.

Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/mpp0zc/arranged_marriages_and_its_effect_on_mental_health/,4/12/2021 22:28,81,0,39,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

He is hardworking and punctual guy who scores more than average in exam.He came from scholarships and resides near college area in rent . As I see him and his financial condition I feel kind to him . I often talk to him . Contrasting to his shy social nature he is fond of making tiktok videos, likes to participate in college dance program and he has an strong urge to be actor. Because of his social restrictions by his nature he doesn't hang around with his friends and has an routine of coming to college , studying in class , Finishing assignments etc . I find it so sad that he is unable to explore and express his artistic part in open applicable way and want him to get deserving status . He likes a girl in our class and its open and out in class.Girl is quite friendly and social in class . He tried to talk to that girl earlier in class like when in breaks going to her bench and want to have conversations but it would end in cripple way of no way , Though girl was cooperative there . Nowadays he has same old routine staying in his own way in class , talking barely and studying !

Even if our conversation are friendly and you give me a side eye or make a face i get anxious i start worrying if i said something wrong. 

Even if you call me names or pick on i have severe anxiety. As if my chest will explode. It hurts. 

Now coming to the topic of my meternal family, it sucks, my thulo mama his face is expressionless. He just doesn’t smile and just is very silent. He is a banker and he is very good at socializing. He makes fun of everyone and makes jokes picks on people even kids calls them names. 

In my family everyone thinks he is smart clever and everything because be is the one that studied masters and what not i think its bba or something idk but he did graduate from lord buddha college that i know and he is very manipulative. He is also investing in stocks and is the only person in our family to have a very vast knowledge about it.

Just in yesterday i was learning to fly kite and i have never flown before and he was teaching us and he was expression less as usual and was calling us name like bheja and murkha and what not. He insults me if i dont get the thing hes saying or of he has to repeat what again just even twice.

He acts as if he is a sigma. As if everything he says is cool and he usually dominates people with his insults and comebacks and calling us name. He thinks that he is the only one clever.

And if someone goes against him or says something about his opinion he usually calls us name insults us and if were wrong god he does everything in his power to smash us to the ground with his insults and the names.

I am fourteen and i am scared of him. I am scared sometimes to even talk to him, i act as if hes gonna eat me alive with his word. I believe in stoicism  but the philosophy isnt helping i think this is a childhood trauma and  to overcome it. I need help. He is rude to me whenever we have a social gathering he pays more attention to other kids even his friends kids he pays more attention to.and he usually calls me by a funny name or picks on me he is like bully who is sometimes nice but most of the time he is a bully.

uje17y,I feel lost,"I(18/M), since childhood, have always been an introvert and didn't really had much social life. Im a people pleaser and I mostly spent my entire life in my room. I was instructed to study and score good marks cause thats what good boys do, right? I really never had any close connection with anyone(including my siblings and parents) as I have always been distant from people. When i was in school, i tried to be friends with few but all they did was use me for my homeworks and notes. I didnt really care too. And in highschool, i met some wonderful people in my life but I pushed them away cause i had a fear of abandonment and didn't wanna get hurt. 

And after my graduation, i wanted to take a gap year. My mental health was a mess and also i didn't really want to rush into admission without researching about my major. But my parents and relatives brainwashed me into getting an admission. They used these heavy words and it made me question my decisions. I got paranoid and felt like ""They are more experienced than me, they know whats best for me"". I tried to tell them how i feel about it but all they did was gaslight my opinions saying ""Baccha xas, talai kei thaha xaina. taile vaneko manena vane taile pakka future ma regret garxas."" I got scared. I valued their opinion more than mine and i regret that so much. 

Even though i was all by myself since childhood, i was happy. I was that guy always have a smile and motivates other to do well. Loneliness never bothered me tbh. Even in highschool, my classmates used to question me about how do i stay happy all the time. Now its almost like the smile had been faded away and all its left is pitch darkness. 

Its been like  month since my college had started and it feels like everyday i force myself to go even though i know i dont want this. I was so excited for my bachelor's and suddenly boom. Everything's gone. I havent even told my parents. Im afarid of getting scolded.
I feel so hopeless and i have no motivation to keep going anymore. Ever since I got an admission I have been having panic attcks and emotional breakdowns. My thoughts keeps me wide awake till 3am and lately been crying myself to sleep everyday. 

Its my fault as well, i couldn't decide what i want and couldn't speak for myself. Ever since i completed my +2, it feels like i've been pushed into a completely different life and its so traumatizing. The pressure, those expectations, those dreams, my sanity, it feels like everything has been crushed. I have never felt this low in my life and i just dont know. I dont know whats wrong and whats right anymore. I dont know who should i blame. Is it my relatives? My parents? Or am i overreacting? Are my emotions even valid? I just dont know.

Last night, I  didnt make  the dinner, now i am starving. Yet, I dont feel the urge to step out of the bed. 
It feels like I try to find excuses rather than giving an effort to accomplish it.  I have such a poor mentality.  I try to justify that mentality rather than improving  it.
Life has been bland  at this point. I dont even remember the last time I laughed openly.  
 Meme doesnt me chuckle,  comedy movies feels crap, stand-up feels like  rant, Happy faces on social media feels fake.
I have been lonely since child hood. Hostel life since  10 yrs old, bullied to that extent  you and i cant even imagine,  started living in a rented room since high school.  Now, I am doing Bachelor ( I had to google for correct spelling). My hometown is far away from Ktm. I have been visiting   my parents once in a year since 10 yrs old.  Never had the environment to develop social skill or relationships. I dont even know my closest relatives.  Never had that confidence to be really good at something. Never had some talents. Never had that good personality. I find myself quite repulsive. Never been into relationshiop. Never really  had good friends (well, I thought i had some, but they werent actually) 
Now, my life goes without even talking to someone in real.  It has been 5 years  living in this room, and this neighbour who is really, like 2 meter close, to my room, i see them everyday,  I have never made a good talk with me. Whenever i feel they are out there, i try not to step out of the room. I try to make myself non-existent to them,  also  to every people out there. 
Really bhannu parda, I dont even want to hear what you guys are going to reply to  this.  I know  what  I should be doing. 
Be  really self discplined 
 spend time with things that you enjoy them most ( I have none )
 Read some self help books (  never worked) 
Novels, movies and music ( used to enjoy at certain point, not now ) 
Try to talk  with strangers in online ( becomes anxious within minutes ) 
Hike around (  Used to hike frequently, now it is boring to hike alone) 
Be good at your studies ( used to be good, but dont have that discipline ) 
Pick up some skill ( bought guitar, ahile ghaado bhako chha, bought an expensive laptop to pickup some internet skill, now I dont want to be hooked with digital things, tried to improve writing skill, that didnt work well ) 
Do gym (  gone for like two months,  that place became a house of mental anxiety, too   many people ) 
Do  outdoor running ( its on and off. Mostly off) 
It is just that  I have not found thing I truly enjoy or that i think i will enjoy  onwards.  Now, I try to make myself non-existent to my family, to my *friends. Yet, i starve for human touch and companion.. I want to be in relationship. Yet I dont find myself attractive, how girls will find me ! There are  couple of rejections to add to that. Hahaha. 
I was hungy while  i started writing this, now i dont feel a bit.    This rant has taken more than an hour to write. This way I try to spend my life now and then. Just unproductive.

14l3q9i,Shey Phoksundo Trek - Help,"Hi all, I am from TN, India. Backpacking Nepal was my biggest dream and recently I left my old job and found a new one just so I can take 1 month off between the transition. My YT algo is filled with videos of manang, tilicho lake, phoksundo, dolpa, langtang, Three passes, Gokyo, Tso rolpa, etc.  


Among these I feel that phoksundo tops the list because of its pristine huge lake and its remoteness. So requesting you guys to answer or clear my doubts on some questions.  


Few Info about me before I start asking questions,  
A. I am planning to backpack Nepal from 12th July to 5th August.  
B. I have severe anxiety issues and hate going in groups for treks. I like to travel alone in silence.  
C. I have my own tent, sleeping gears and cooking gears.  
D. I prefer doing backpacking on a budget but taking a flight is really required to fit everything in my timeline I will do it.  
E. My preferred places to visit are Phoksundo lake, Langtang valley, Tilicho lake and Tso rolpa.  


Questions,  
1.  Is it possible at all to get a solo trekking permit for phoksundo? If yes, What are the steps? If no, then sadface emoji.  
2. Since I belong to SAARC nation, Do I require national park special permit or just an entry pass which can be bought at the gates of phoksundo starting point?  
3. According to a YT channel's latest phoksundo video, summitair have started a new route - Kathmandu to Juphal instead of Kathmandu to Nepalgunj to Juphal. Is this true?  
4. What documents do I have to submit to get a Nepalese SIM card?  
Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/14l3q9i/shey_phoksundo_trek_help/,6/28/2023 8:26,9,0,12,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

I have been using this room freshener for last 2weeks and it's really good when mixed with oils (ayurvedic) it creates an aroma effect to the air and purifies it. It relieves my anxiety , stress and overthinking with its fragnance of oil comes with the room freshener's vapour. Some of its oils have its own benefits such as for depression, anxiety and mind relaxation, I am using peppermint oil and lemon grass combined. For Acne, dead skin cells , anti-inflammatory, pore obstruction, digestion, you should use eucalyptus oil with this aroma machine. Other oils has its own health benefits. Except it, Its scent is so good and doesn't contain any side effects but the one which was only for fragnance has had me some effect as I was struggling with my eyes. It caused swelling in my eyes and made me rub till the tears come out. So I recommend only using ayurvedic oils.

I checked myself with different other doctors but they didn't call it a heart problem. They said ki ""SEE ko chinta le hola"". Later on, I found ki I start overthinking for small problems too.

I don't know ki what happened to myself. I was a kind of guy who used to be happy all the time and used to talk with others. But I don't know how i converted myself from more talkative boy to less talkative boy. I feel ki everyone hates me because I don't have good personality, I didn't score good marks and I spend most of the time infront of the computer. 

People call me ""Lato, Sanka , Ghamandi,alxi"". I know how to cook food. I help my parents and I can also wash my own clothes. I clean my room too but not constantly.  I am only comfortable with only few people. Others  just complain me ki ""Ghar bata Baira niskinna, Sathi sanga kheldaina  , Khali kotha vitra Ghumsera Basxa"".

156fflz,"Transcendental Meditation (TM) - worth it? Have any or some of you taken ""mantra initiation"" ?","Thinking of subscribing to TM as I am attracted to mantra meditation. There have been so many independent researches on this particular meditation which is linked with decrease in stress and anxiety. A new father and a family person, I am exposed to so many stressors than before so I need to deal with them before they affect my well being.

I know that they charge you for the mantra, but I feel Rs. 10,000 is nothing compared to the state of mind with reduced, if not free of anxiety (I think being anxiety-free is much rare in the world we're living unless you are genetically gifted or are a simple farmer happy with your family and the yield of your farm). I know I can find a lot of free resources on meditation in the internet but I also feel having paid the significant sum makes you more disciplined and plus, although I don't fully buy into it, the mantras are supposed to have special vibrations that affect your psyche and body in certain way.

17z23kx,Dislike towards parents,"Parenting
A child is trying to climb a tree; what will you do? You immediately become afraid – he may fall, he may break his leg, or something may go wrong. And out of your fear you rush and you stop the child. If you had known what joy it is to climb a tree, you would have helped so that the child could learn how to climb trees! And if you are afraid, help him, go and teach him. You also climb with him! Help him learn so he doesn´t fall. Your fear is good – it shows love, that the child may fall, but to stop the child from climbing the tree is to stop the child from growing. There is something essential about climbing trees. If a child has never been doing it, he will remain in some way poor, he will miss some richness – for his whole life. You deprive him of something beautiful, and there is no other way to know about it! And once in a while, falling from a tree is not so bad either. Rather than being deprived forever.
""If a child has never been doing it, he will remain in some way poor""
I have become a very dull and naive adult because my parents always raised me as their shadow. They never encouraged me to do anything except study and get good marks Or in other words they discouraged me from trying other activities telling  me that study should be given primary focus. They never allowed me to socialize. They locked me inside room and tricked me to study my whole childhood. They don't talk with me about anything except my studies. I cannot be open and share anything with them . I have started hating them for the way they over sheltered me . They never taught me any useful skills.Never tried to teach me any game or sing or dance.Now I am suffering from social anxiety. I don't know when I got it. Through what experiences I got it . But I am suffering in my daily life and am unable to share with anybody about this. My parents and relatives think that I have grown up ver dumb and weak. It is somewhat true. I am unable to help myself. I have very low self esteem and feel ashamed of myself and I partly I blame my parents for this. They too know that I cannot even go to shopping by myself .that I don't have friends and I am suffering from low confidence but they never talk to me about it. They don't want to talk about it . Seems like they don't care anything about me . 
So want to know your opinion is this blame that I am putting on my parents valid?

pcmpm0,Can we talk about the absurdity of the Nepalese Education System on the exclusion of Mental health issues?,"Seriously this needs more talking now more than ever. I could bet all my money (not that i have any) on the fact at least 90 percent of students in the Nepalese curriculum are actively suffering of some form of mental illness . Take this as an example .Some shake it off as a stomach pain when they have a heavy stomach as if it had sunk. Stomach pain and anxiety are not the same. There\`s no inclusion of any mental illness ,their symptoms and so on at the curriculum at all. I think all of us at grade 7-  10 know why  smoking and drinking is bad for us. For fu\*k sake it\`s the same shit every year just worded differently. With all respect the education system is fully to blame on how fu\*ked up this generation\`s  mental health is. Both diagnosed and un-diagnosed ones. There is nothing wrong with you if you have any problem communicating, dealing with people or are always worried about something. This does not make you weak ,and no you can\`t just shake it off like people tell you. There\`s a reason why it\`s regarded as illness. There\`s nothing to be ashamed about talking about it. If you do feel like you\`re not fitting in ,having  trouble mentally ,it is not something  to leave ignored. Seek medical help.

v11heb,Does it happen with everyone or is it just me being paranoid?,"I often get scared and feel very awkward to go outside. I usually stay in my room all the time unless I am starving or have some important work to do. So yesterday evening, I mustered up a little courage to take a short walk to get some fresh air. While returning, a guy behind me said Oh, Hello in louder voice. I don't know if he was talking on the phone. I looked back, there were two guys ig ( I didn't notice properly). I panicked and walked as faster as I could up to a galli leading to where I live. Then, I ran from that galli.

&#x200B;

Maybe that person was just calling his friend or talking to his friend. I don't know why I got panicked. This happens almost all the time. This might be because I am paranoid most of the time whenever I go outside alone. I don't want to make anyone feel bad or as if they've done something wrong unless they haven't. But I get scared too instantly. Usually म एकोहोरो भइराको हुन्छु, आफ्नै तालमा अनि त्यस्तो बेला मा कोहि बोल्यो या बोलायो भने म झस्किहाल्छु (तर्सिन्छु ), Classroom मा होस् या घरमा होस्, यस्तै भइराको हुन्छ ।

1aij64o,Difusser with ayurveda essential oil,"Hi this is Ambience Nepal from the Himalayans. Are you struggling with stress/tension/anxiety, muscles pain, acne and bad environment and other health problems? Don't worry. We got you but let me know tell me few things you should know before reaching to the end. Everytime we breathe, the non-intangible things contained in the air including contaminated air, gas, bad smell and pollution get inside of your body through blood and respiratory system. Your whole body reflection depends on what kind of environment you are staying in. After hours of work, that pollution when you travel, we become anxious, stressed when the works aren't completed, and sometimes fever, cough and common cold due to the bad air. 
Well, here we are now to the solution. If you are really struggling with such things, you should get the ayurvedic oils from the Himalayans along with room freshener. It's made up of different herbs and shrubs found in Nepal such as Laaliguras Oil which helps in increasing your immune system, reduces stress-related condiitons and the scent is just WOW.  And in the other hand, we have Himalayan Silver Fir Oil which is for reducing bad fragnance, deodorants, detoxification, respiratory improvement and body bad odor reduction and Velerian Oil for good sleep.
 We have 35 different types of oil from the Himalayans and each of it has its own benefits. Let me mention some of the problems you guys might have; Headache, sleeplessness, insomnia, muscular pain, inflammations, rashes, migraine, low immune system, armpit bad smell, high blood pressure, bad fragnance, respiratory improvement and menstrual pains. Best for the offices, restaurants, car, home garden, spas, and other administrative locations.

16f4nzh,National Suicide Prevention Day,"TW: Talked about suicide and self harm

I don’t remember much from that day. It was Baishakh 28, 2078.

If you are one of those who feel like “suicide is selfish, aajkal ka bachha laai yestaai k k ho” then you can block me but please don’t leave a hate comment.

When I was about 15, I suddenly started feeling weird and scared almost all the time. That was new since, I was a bubbly ambiverted kid who participated in every debates, oratory and even anchored during parents day when there were nearly 1000 people. Suddenly, I was scared to raise my hand in grade 11 to ask questions. It simply started this way. Suddenly, I was tired frequently and frustrated as well. I started getting anxious for no reasons. Sometimes, I’d cry like ten to fifteen times a day and sometimes I’d be numb and won’t cry for like three to four months. My grades went downhill. I scored 3.85 in SEE and 3.19 in grade 11. My parents were stressing out too but I had no idea what was happening. I knew answers to the questions but when I’d start writing, I would forget everything. It became even worse during the lockdown when I was in grade 12. I completed grade 12 with pretty average gpa and joined computer engineering.

I don’t even remember what happened in those few months of gap. I would rarely get out of my room and even bed at times. I’d say I was studying or make some excuses. I’d go days without brushing and even showering. I used to eat alone. Bihana aru vanda chitto khayera vada majthye ani kotha ma aauthye ani beluka saab khaaisakexi maatrai janthye. Ma khaja pani khassai khadina thye. Padhiraxa vanera maamu haru ley kei lyaaidia nii vok lagya xaina vanthye. Kailey online class vanthye kailey saathi sanga question answer discuss gareera ho vanthye. Since, I was pretty good kid, they would believe me. Yesto huda hudaai, I started feeling even more scared and anxious about everything. Mailey sikaideko saathi haru ley ma vanda badi gpa lyaaexi ta ma jhan k vaaye k. I started feeling like failure. I come from a joint family and I was the oldest of my generation. I was the kind of cousin people would set example about. Ani jasley phone garey pani “Padhaai ka pugyo? Mero chhora chorri lai nii timi jastai gyani, padhney banaideuna” vanna thalexi ta ma jhan k vaaye k.

I remember feeling worthless, scared and ugly. And one day I suddenly started feeling suicidal. Kaasto mardim mardim laagney. Ma bachyo vaney ta jhan ghar ko manxey ko paisa nii sakkinxa, ijjat pani jaanxa jaastai hunthyo ani on one of those days I tried to jump off the terrace. Jhandai 4 talla bata jump garera taala stone ma bajariyo vaney ta ma bachney aas nai hudaina nii samma plan garisakya thye. I’d thought about the ways to die before but at that moment I literally planned everything. The only reason I kinda stopped was because baba called me to help him fix some stuff and that was pretty urgent. After that day, I kinda realized everything that was happening to me wasn’t normal.

Two years later, I’m on medicine and therapy. Although, I’m still not perfectly fine, I’m living rather than existing. To everyone reading this, “You are loved, cherished and cared for. You just haven’t met all the people who are going to love and cherish you. You’re not alone.”

1amvc8b,For the person getting suicidal thoughts...,"
Are you thinking about suicide? Contact a suicide hotline in Nepal
If you're experiencing suicidal thoughts, you're not alone. Suicidal thoughts aren't talked about very much, but many people experience them during their lives. There are 3 suicide hotlines (crisis lines or helplines) in Nepal that can help. If you're not sure what suicidal thoughts look like, they might look like any of the following:

Making plans for ending your life
Feeling like you can't cope with the pain anymore
Losing your motivation to keep going
Feeling like you don't deserve to go on
Thinking you're going to feel this way forever
Looking up information about how to kill yourself
Not wanting to be alive anymore
A sense of finality, as if there is no other choice
When you're suicidal, you're going through an emotional crisis. Being in crisis mode can give rise to intense emotions that are difficult to process. You may be overwhelmed and want nothing more than for the pain to end. It may not seem like it, but things can get better.

It's normal to feel like nobody will get you when you're feeling suicidal. It may even feel like you're beyond help. But crisis supporters don't think so. Crisis supporters in Nepal want to help you and they are available 24/7 to lend a listening ear.

If you are having thoughts of suicide today, consider contacting a helpline in Nepal for free, confidential help.",https://findahelpline.com/countries/np/topics/suicidal-thoughts,2/9/2024 18:43,11,0,0,English,1,0,1,0,1,2
yril5s,How to handle a suicidal person?,"Long story but keeping it as short as possible, talked with someone from Facebook group, like we meet new people in Facebook,  I owned the group, Hi, hellos and all, came to know she was abandoned by father and step mom recently that time, and that is a Mahabharat in itself, will not go there. And due to Covid her job pay was due for long, and eventually the company didn't pay anyone, she had taken some loans from sahakari too with the help of her friend,  and started living in a hostel. She was going through difficult times. Fortunately, Luckily, I had some work opportunities to be delegated then, me being a project manager,  so gave the work, and a year of good earning, she paid back her loans, and all was fine, Then the work ceased after around 1 year. The savings started to dry up, I suggested her to find another job and do that a job. She was the kind to not be interested in doing hard jobs, that's the thing I hated about her, even though I hunted down few jobs for her, She wanted job of her kind and eventually she didn't do any job, and came up with an idea to start a small business related to clothes, I said that's a bad idea but she did what she had to do. Aba usko money, usko ichya anyway. Business is hard to run, she came to know this the hard way, All she was doing was breaking even in business, and nothing for herself, not to even pay to hostel, I helped her financially here too now and then from my pocket, for the next 6 months, knowing the fact that I will not get the money back, It was a help.  


Now the situation is I can't just take care of her finances this like forever, I haven't met her yet, neither I have any intentions to. I just helped because I could help, she doesn't want to quit her business and do job, And now she always comes up with ""Aba ma marchu"" , Its been going on since a month and more now, after every few days she says she will die, I try to calm her down, and say possible solutions, but she still insists ""aba bachera kaam chaina, marchu"" .  Job gara bhanda, business ko k garnu bhancha, eh baba business bata suko haat audaina, ani testo business k kaam, job gara at least afno kharcha aucha, stability hola, pachi savings hola ani then again garaula business teti saro nai interest bhaye bhanda ni mandaina.  


Ani this feeling of guilt comes up, ya u can support her so support her more till she is stable, and the other side of me says, this is a never ending thing, don't be a stupid,  you will be like a foster parent to her for the rest of life, I obviously don't want her to get hurt or anything, bas I just don't know how to fix this. Or should I just be like I don't care ? I have seen people not giving a fuck about a human but are worried when their phone gets scratched, but me being the opposite is now giving me this problem.

It may not be the right time and the right situation to talk about this but truth should prevail. While fake rape charges on men are being high we shouldn’t believe in instant justice like hanging the rapist. Let a detailed inquiry and investigation happen.

Yes there might be problems with the rule of law and whole judicial system. That needs to be improved. But the rush and haste to hang the suspects might kill the innocent ones. That again would be a big crime and bring next revolt.

Another side of the story.

Yo aama chai she was around 75 yo. Waha le dherai dukha garera chhori haru hurkaunu vako. Padhe lekheko ni haina tyo aama. Her husband was epileptic ani died early. Teti belako society ma her dewar n his family made her life hell. Yet, she did everything she could for those 2 daughters, sent them to school, managed everything she had to and got them married.

Fate had good plans for them as they're FUCKING WEALTHY. They got married to businessmen ani their business took off and made like crores of money.

Perfect examples to young girls like us, right? Independent earning women also got married to rich husbands taking care of their unwell mom.

17c9wal,I'm not gonna make it,"For the longest time, I had held on to hope that maybe some miracle would happen and my life, essentially me myself, would change in an instant and become a functioning adult. Right now I'm almost 20(M) and almost halfway through uni. But as I look back at my teenage years, I can see nothing but failure. Failure to live up to what me, my family or anyone else would naturally expect in this time frame.

This one might be long because I've had this bottled up for quite some time and I want to release it all right here. I haven't found any better place to rant than this subreddit, much so because it feels like a home at this point.

**There will be a tl;dr at the end if it does get long.**

*Maile kei sikna sakina.*

I'm surrounded by all types of people, those with what I could call a non-volatile skillset and those who are jack of all trades. But as the teenage years come to an end, I find myself not belonging in any of them. I'm not particularly good at studies.. well I used to be, back when everything was easier. Now, I can't pass a subject properly even after giving it my all. I try to blame it on myself for not trying harder but then again beyond this point I would become insane. I'm not good at sports either, never was. I tried all sorts of them in my young years, couldn't get half decent in any. I even tried to narrow down what I played the most and even then I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Same thing with other ECAs during school. I've always been way too clumsy as compared to my peers and I mess every little thing up so much that whatever I'm trying to do, becomes unbearable to even watch.

Gharma pani I tried to take up some hobbies. I tried drawing but ultimately gave up in a couple of years after I got nowhere. I love to make noises (i.e. try to sing) but my voice would scare everyone away if I tried in front of people, say.. Gian(from doraemon) in real life. I also gave a quick shot at dancing but dropped that idea right away because I immediately realized I wasn't cut out for it either. I'm not very gifted in the physical department either. I am as strong as a sparrow, and although I'm ""slightly tall"" for Nepalese society at just 5'9, a couple of years ago I developed this unflinching obsession towards height. Now I just get intimidated whenever I come across a person (usually of the opposite gender) of similar or higher stature. It's very uncomfortable of a feeling and I'm not able to shrug it off yet even though I'm looking for ways to be complacent with what I have and not look at the food at other's plate.

Maybe all this insecurity stems from not having someone who truly cares but I have a track record of burning down a platonic friendship because I was insecure. Though I have thus recovered from such extremities, I still am, for the most part, tangled in my own self-created and self-sustaining cycle of problem creation, resolution and re-creation. Talking of friendship, In all these years of being alive, I have not made but one meaningful bond with anyone outside of my own family. Even within my family I get called anti-social very often. I am not very good at initiating talks that captivate people and charm them with my inherent allure. In fact I don't have any such inherent ""good vibes"", at least that's what all this isolation has led me to believe. It's not like I haven't tried. I attempted at making friends in school, high school and currently in uni as well but as you might have guessed, I failed to keep up. The bridges I built were way too fragile and they got vaporized without even being aware. In a nutshell I have a terrible impression on people, without having or showing (as far as I'm aware) any ill intent.

I am an extremely gullible person. I don't know what the causes for this are but aren't children supposed to shed off this ""disease"" by the end of their teenage years? What kind of life did all the people around me have which made them so much different from I am, so much ""higher level"" than I am, in life. Why did everyone I grew up with learn so much about everything while... maile kei siknai sakina?

&#x200B;

*Feeling like I won't amount to anything.*

As of now, I'm doing an undergrad in engineering in Nepal. These 4 years are on their way to vanish into the void of yesteryear soon. As I've said in one of my earlier rants (if you've read any), I didn't ""choose"" this field of study. I gave myself many options because I wasn't really sure. The options ranged from medical to engineering to commerce but in the end looking at my performance and social stature, I had to go with eng. Even though I'm already this far and now I've finally gotten to a point of acceptance in my choice, as there's nothing better I can do now. I'm just as clueless as I was before joining uni. I am trying to acquire skills that'd be useful later but I haven't found anywhere to actually put them to the test. I can't think of an idea to make a project, nor can I find a job especially with my utter lack of soft skills like Interpersonal and Communication. This puts me at a major disadvantage with nobody to blame but myself. All I've learnt from mistakes is to avoid making them and in that attempt, I sometimes end up not trying at all.

I wanted to go abroad for my masters but in the current state, I'm really afraid of not getting any scholarships when I try for the US. I have other options like Australia and Germany as well, but for some reason the US just excites me a lot. This is a question for a later thread maybe if I'm still indecisive by then because this isn't something I want to burden myself with before reaching the end of my degree. My percentages are horrible. By the end of the 4th year I expect them to be close to 70% only, which is a big blow to my aspirations for a master's in a different country. I couldn't go out after +2 because I was scared of facing life head on, and thought I wasn't prepared. And it is this cowardice that scares me the most. Am I just too afraid to take risks? Will this nature propel me to a natural downfall?

I am always surrounded by these dark thoughts. It's like I have nothing to keep me company, even though there's lots of things I try to do to keep myself occupied. Nothing seems to stop the negative aura from seeping into my mind in sudden bursts at random time points. What if I can't find a job after I go out? I don't even have people I can rely on abroad which could give me some peace of mind. And what if the job I might eventually get stuck in gives me no satisfaction at all. It's not like I have good interpersonal skills to be able to negotiate a good salary, or just network my way into a better job. Parents keep reminding me that I have the responsibility of my family under my shoulders now and I should be better than everyone else but I can't shrug off the fear of what will happen when they find out I can't be what they have always made me out to be? What will happen when no matter how much potential I might have in their eyes, I just can't materialize that because I succumbed to the pressure.

But maybe there's time for me to figure this out. Maybe if I just go with the flow of life, I will land some place where I'm meant to be, with some person I'm meant to be with, doing some thing I'm destined to do. This is the only thought that keeps me afloat. It's okay if I fail. It's okay if I hurt the only people who have ever given me love because I'm a piece of shit, because maybe all that was just written in the stars. I'll give it my all, but if all isn't enough, what is there to despair about.

Maybe I will not amount to anything. Maybe I just won't make it at all. And maybe ...it's okay?

&#x200B;

Now this became sad cringe real fast but some portions were a bit exaggerated because I was going in a flow I guess. Thanks for reading through to the end. Please shed some pieces of advice if you can, or some life experiences if you've ever been in a similar situation. I appreciate every person who decides to say something.

hvju6u,My problem with this whole media circus around our new national treasure (Vijay Shahi).,"In his previous YouTube interview (link in comment) about 5 months ago he said he will go US for one years come back and go back again for four years . He claimed he will go to NASA , find out what are they lacking, do the research and invent ""something"" (yeah fuck science and scientists who've devoted their whole life). Okay lets give him the  benefit of doubt and say he has eidetic memory (which is in itself highly debatable and has lot of skeptics), it still doesn't clarify wtf he is gonna do in NASA. In his latest interviews he is avoiding mentioning NASA thing and focusing more on how he gonna change our whole education system with his ""formula"". simple google search of his world record claims leads us to a shady website from Andra Pradesh with some questionable records.

My problem with this whole situation is how government officials are giving him tax payer money in lakhs. All the top political leaders are eager to meet him and ignorant ""journalist"" like Rishi dhamala are pushing him and sensationalising it. (fuck important  issues like covid 19 and highest suicide rate in decades) We nepali people are so gullible(parents and some highly educated friends) that we believe everything that's on YouTube, be it some fortune teller to some delusional inventors  (made in Nepal helicopter and cars).

12gbp6f,Is it normal that my parents are accustomed to constant berating and making their children feel worthless?,"I'm a girl born to a middle class family of a retired army father and a housewife mother. For all my life, I was raised to be the ideal child that my parent always wanted me to be. From early on, I was academically competent, honest, respecting and obedient child who believed and obeyed whatever my parents told me. I was expected to make little to no friends, no going out of home unless for studies, no communication with friends or neighbors without any significant work. So, thanks to that, i was a total loner and an introvert who had lot of trouble in socializing and adapting. The only few times I have went outside are the times when I lied about going out for some projects and study purposes or they won't let me. I had no luxury of having devices like my other peers and still don't do till this day. I literally had to study my ass off to get the little attention that my parents provided to me when i aced the exams. My parents were there physically but they were absent emotionally and never communicated about our thoughts. Their expectations on me had always been high since day one, and if i failed to fulfill their expectations, they would always mentally guilt-trip and scold me nonstop. I was always trying to overdo myself to make them happy but my parents never saw my struggles.

&#x200B;

When, I was about 11/12 yrs old, I lost my old best friend and it took a huge toll on me mentally. I had only two real friends who were really close and cared about me. But, suddenly, one of them passed away and the another one moved to another school. Then, I was there all alone with no friends. Puberty was slowly kicking in and me, a socially inept teen, was more troubled by my fears and insecurities. This phase of life really taught me a lot to not trust even the closest ppl around me. I was finally picking up the 1st hobby i enjoyed - dancing, but my parents forced me to not follow my heart so that it wouldn't hamper my studies. I left dancing thinking that my parents know the best for me. My parents' strict parenting made it impossible for me to really know myself and have a life out of my studies. I was rarely permitted to go outside with my friends- only once or twice in a year and I was grounded most of the time. I was never really taught to be independent. My parents always scolded me for the most trivial matters and made me feel like I'm nothing w/o my academical successes. They were only focused on my studies but not how i was mentally drained all the time. I was always picked on by my classmates who never really spoke to me unless they wanted notes. I was always very anxious of being judged by the people and always tried to push myself more to fulfill others' expectations on me. I nearly went anorexic and suicidal once. My mental health declined day by day and I was stringing to life with the only hope of being independent and free from home someday. I again started liking singing but they forced me out of it too. My parents manipulated me to giving up everything that made me happy and alive. They always thought physical violence and verbal altercation were the best ways to train a child rather than loving and understanding and communicating openly. They never showed any signs of affection and care whenever I was down but rather scolded and caused me to have mental breakdowns habitually. Still, I passed my 10th grade with highest markings as the only girl topper in my school. They coerced me into studying science in +2 when I had no any interest in it and didn't choose opt. math in my secondary years to study so i was doomed miserably.   


I moved to Kathmandu in hope of distancing myself from the troubles and felt the first sense of independence and freedom as i left my home. You know you are totally fucked up when even your home don't feel like home. I finally felt home and in peace. I was so relieved w/o all the daily emotional torment and was finally seeing the real me myself w/o anyone's opinions and choosing what i desired. But, the aftermath of choosing science which i didn't even had a passion for slowly started to dawn on me. The tension brought upon by study just further pushed me to the deepest sinkhole of distress. Some shitty ppl in the college even made it worse but anyhow with the last strength, I passed my +2.   


Then, My parents moved to Kathmandu and the daily misery started all over again. I was planning to take a year off or do study something i had interest on i.e. Bachelor in Arts but they didn't allow me. I cried so many times in front of them during the troubling times of +2. Even my uncles who didn't really cared about me, saw my crippling mental health and suggested my parents to not to force me anymore but to no avail. They compelled me to give CEE exams and pursue medical field. But due to no ability to withstand any longer and no interest, I gave up and failed my exams knowingly. Now, I'm planning to go abroad to study bachelors and I can't wait to leave my home. Ik I'm kinda being selfish but I've decided to choose me and my mental health first. I'm grateful to my parents because they had led me to become who i'm rn but I've already paid enough expenses of my mental sanity for that. Maybe, their way of treating me is just a generational curse but it still doesn't give them the right to deny all the troubles i went through and make me feel like shit. I've never felt how it's like to be loved genuinely by my parents especially my dad. I think it was because of my dad being a military man and him always having to put on a mask of being tough. But, he always scolds us whenever he speaks to us but always speaks politely with others. He likes playing with other's children but he hated being around us when we were little. Sometimes, I get so sad and jealous when I see others' dad supporting their children and loving them and wish I had a relation like that with my dad as well. I've cried and consulted so many times with my parents about their toxic parenting but they still don't want to change their way and mindset. They still berate me daily and make me feel guilty but ig I'm wanting to be resilient and a rebel this time to not give up on my happiness. I broke my mobile once during the pandemic and i still haven't got my mobile back. They are my parents and i love them very much and i can't run away from them all my life but this time, it's the only option i see to save myself from going insane. Ig it's just Nepali parenting but I don't want anyone to be suffer like me and I won't raise my children to live a life of constant self-doubt and mental excruciation and restraint on their choices on their happiness. Parents are there to guide, love and support their children not to control, manipulate or mold them into desired version.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/12gbp6f/is_it_normal_that_my_parents_are_accustomed_to/,4/9/2023 6:58,70,0,32,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

ofcz0g,I need your help,"This may come as desperate but im in no position to not be desperate. Hang with me through this long post.


You may remember me as the person whose brother attempted suicide a month back. I would have liked to update you with some good news but honestly, i don't have anything good to deliver to say.


As for the update, The doctor recommended we put him in a psychiatric ward for a minimum of six months. We were reluctant and mom was understandably disturbed. That was not going to happen anytime soon. We took him back after 3 days and he was in our watch 24/7.


But as god has it ( this thing really isn't in our side), a fatherly figure in our neighborhood, who had horrible alcoholism for some years hanged himself and guess who saw him do it?


It was really difficult after that, we had really tried to make it as peaceful as possible in our home. We just wanted him to be somewhat calm mentally before admitting in the psychiatric hospital.


As understanding as i can be, this ordeal has been really tiring for all of us and i can see that he feels the same and i donot want him to feel burdened at this time. Our father has been working less to support us mentally and emotionally. There has been a lot of family moments that i wouldn't have imagined was possible in my lifetime. Maybe it does get better.


But again as god is willing, a brother (dai) of his that he was close to died yesterday in a horrible accident.


He seems calm but i don't know how long he can take it. I feel like there is an invisible ticking bomb that is just waiting to go off. I don't want to think what that trigger will be. Our parents are really anxious, i know they feel the same. I can see the fears in their eyes.


As for my brother, i am at least relieved that he talks freely about his thoughts and feelings. We took him for counseling again but the doctor didn't noticed anything wrong that ringed alarms bells but i don't agree with it. I maynot see it but i do feel something. 


This has been really hard and im glad i could take it off my chest. I know i don't know any of you personally but your silent presence have been a great relief for me. And i want to thank all of you for that. I don't know why im feeling so grateful these days.


Coming to the main point, since our dad is not working, we are in dire financial situation. There is another suffering on the horizon and i want to prevent it as much as i can. I want to work to help him in some ways.

 Any work is fine. I don't have any specific skills but im confident and willing to learn for less pay. I have fair faith in my writing skills but i haven't tested it yet. 
Any online  job that i would be able to deliver will be fine.
If you guys can help then that'll be great.

1bribsp,Whats going wrong with the education system in Nepal,"With the most feared and talked about SEE examinations ongoing, interesting statistics and data reflecting upon Nepal's current education status are being published.One of the major topics highlighted by these data is the drastic difference between the amount of students enrolling in the first grade and the number of students applying for the SEE examinations.

In this report we will be highlighting the main factors which are acting to cause the aforementioned problems. A recent study by the Department of Education shows that while 11 lakh students were enrolled in grade 1, only 5 lakh had applied for the SEE examination. This substantial decrease of approximately 6 lakh students over a decade indicates various factors at play leading to this significant decline. The factors can be highlighted into few major point:

1. The Coronavirus Pandemic

The Coronavirus Pandemic is one of the main factors behind the significant drop in the number of candidates participating in the SEE examination. The two year long pandemic significantly affected the learning process in students and significantly impacted their academics.The prolonged closure of schools along with absence of robust remote learning infrastructure led to widespread learning deficit among students. Although few well equipped schools conducted online classes to fill up the void, many students in the rural part of the nation were deprived of education due to the pandemic. The two year gap has forced students to repeat classes owing to the significant difference in the number of students entering the first grade and the number of students applying to give the SEE examination.

1. Foreign Migration Trend

With an increasing number of youth migrating abroad permanently, the trend of inviting family back in Nepal abroad is increasing. Many students, whose parents have migrated abroad, are opting to leave their schooling in Nepal to accompany their families overseas. Consequently, there has been a substantial difference noted between the number of students enrolled in first-grade classes and those applying for the Secondary Education Examination (SEE).This shift in enrollment patterns not only reflects the changing dynamics of family structures due to migration but also underscores the challenges faced by the education system in retaining students amidst such familial transitions. Additionally, it raises concerns about the continuity and completion of education for these students, as well as the potential impact on their academic and socio-economic prospects in both their home country and the destination of migration.

1. Adolescent Mortality 

A recent report states that, ”24.19 percent ( 26.5 million) of Nepal’s population is currently in the age group of 10 to 19 years. The mortality rate of Nepali adolescents stands as high as 90.5 per 100000 adolescents.In an age when high fluctuation of hormones is a common phenomenon, adolescents in Nepal are becoming prone to mental health problems, which if not addressed can result in worst-case scenarios like adolescent suicide. According to the Nepal Health Research Council 2020, 7 in 1000 Nepali adolescents have attempted suicide in their lifetime, while more than 5 percent of adolescents are suffering from mental health disorders.” With such a huge number of vulnerable adolescents and increasing adolescent mortality the number of students are seen to be decreasing rapidly and the academics of the students also seem to have been substantially affected by the increasing mental health problems which has been the main cause for the difference in the number of students enrolled in the first grade and the number of students applying for the SEE examinations.

1. Economic Crisis

The rising costs associated with education, coupled with the growing challenge of sustaining a family on the income of only a few working members, have resulted in a concerning trend: students are compelled to abandon their educational pursuits in favor of seeking employment to support their families financially. This shift underscores the economic pressures faced by households, where the need for immediate financial stability outweighs the long-term benefits of education.Moreover, the correlation between the quality of education and the fees charged exacerbates the situation. As education expenses increase, access to quality education becomes increasingly unattainable for many students from financially constrained backgrounds. Consequently, these students are not only deprived of educational opportunities but also denied the chance to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an increasingly competitive global landscape.

Hence, it is imperative for the relevant authorities to take prompt and decisive action to address this gap in the education system. Failure to do so could result in significant consequences that may profoundly impact the nation as a whole. Therefore, urgent measures must be implemented to mitigate the potential consequences of this issue and ensure the continued progress and development of the education sector.

pks0fl,Sadhguru thoughts about Kathmandu and then Nepal,"I was watching a talk he gave in a hotel in Kathmandu few days ago after he made a trip from Simikot to Limi. Even though I am from Kathmandu, I never knew about how Kathmandu was supposed to be a living spiritual body on itself by design. But because of overpopulation, it has been ruined. When I heard it, I knew what he was talking about. Every 100 meters, there is some temple or murti, we could hear ghanta everywhere all the time. It’s like being surrounded by gods all the time. When Dr. Strange movie came out, I was finally able to see it from an outsider perspective how spritualistic is our city and whole country. 

It’s sad we are loosing it whereas it could have been the key to prosper spiritualism. We Nepali should have been much more relaxed and prosperous like people in Switzerland by having so many resources to tap into and tourism.  Despite having such a unique spiritualism and mountains, we never got to capitalize on it and live a good life. 

The biggest irony at least for me is while most young generation of us want to live abroad and have a good luxurious life, people who been all over the world and done with materialism, they come to Nepal to get what’s actually important in life. Nature and Spiritualism.

10lcs0j,प्रशंग: प्रेम आचार्य,"I see a lot of posts saying ""Let's hope this changes things"" n all. What do you guys think is gonna happen next?

With this post, I intend to open discussion that could yield some pragmatic solutions. Please do correct me in my assumptions / opinions.

Let's look at some major problems Mr. Acharya highlighted in his suicide note: 

1. Market runs completely in credit.

The time a seller needs to wait for payback for their sales is too long and not sustainable when they have to pay loan installments each month to banks. So, what is the solution here? There does not seem to be anything illegal for the government to intervene. This is more of an informal nature in which they do business here which is absolutely not sustainable to small / cottage businesses. Again, I want to clarify that I am not supporting this model. But, there doesn't seem to be an easy solution. Given Nepalese government's past record of mostly failing to act upon simple solutions, it seems less likely that an honest effort will be / can be made to this problem 

2. Banks have a high rate of interest.

I hear Durga Prasai and some other complain about this strongly as well. Banks in Nepal take a collateral, and then charge a really high interest on loan. And failing to pay the installment in time leads to harashment and shaming (publishing photo in major newspaper). Dude you're already eating the collateral, and to add insult to injury, you shame the helpless debtor!! This is a clear problem where fiscal and monetary policies can make a change. Central bank can so something / system can assist it. But, will they do so because of this event? Is it that easy to react to commoners problem and make some major changes in their favor? My doubts sustain.

3. Major businesses not respecting contractual agreement .

Bhat bhateni had an agreement where they commuted to payback the sales within 3 months. Didn't happen. Same issues with some other big players like Big Mart n all. There is no overseeing body where a small business can take up these complaints. Filing a case is one option, but we know how that works. You end up paying more for the process than the outcome (if ever it rolls in your favor).

4. Not being able easily sell products from one region in another region.

This is something I do not have much info about. Maybe someone can help. What is the goal behind all the complicated process for a producer to sell his product in a broader market? If it's creating inconvenience to the seller, why have such regulations in the first place. It will only reduce the amount raised from taxes. But are the policy makers aware of this / care about it?

I wish I could go through each of the issues he mentioned and open a dialogue here. BUT ITS JUST TOO FUCKING MUCH!!! And the most insane part is, that IT'S NOT ALL!!
I hear bits n pieces from relatives and friends that run some business but not one raises a voice. This is the pinnacle of hypernormalization!!! 

He really poured his heart out in his suicide post. These days I can't really read 5 sentences in order, and skim past most of it. But his post was something very articulate, very thorough and full of real crude experience of a commoner in Nepal at present times. As someone who had similar aspirations of doing something in Nepal,  I got chills to my bones trying to understand the pain he might have been through. That pushed a bright mind to choose a willful death in a form that is the most painful, buring himself to ashes. His death is deeply saddening, and is a great metaphor of his dreams that burnt to ashes with him. Not that it matters much what I feel. But, his death, to me, was not a suicide. I consciously and strictly choose to not call it a suicide. It was an act of bravery, an act of valor. May this not go to waste. And may he find peace, at last, for he longed for it through out.

j5jyuv,Does anyone else think that sex as a taboo is one of the reasons for rape cases in Nepal?,"I personally think that considering sex as a taboo is one of the reasons (among many others) why rapes occur. Sex is a basic need of human, but our society considers it as something very sacred and talking about sex openly is still considered as rude. the society considers being in a relation and/or having premarital sex as a huge crime. as a result people have unsatiated sexual desires which they force upon innocent unsuspecting ones or minors who cannot fight against them.

if sex isn't a taboo people in relation can freely have sex or single people can look for options without fearing the judgement of the society. also because we do not talk openly about sex we are unable to properly educate young people about sex. we need to be able teach our children that the only way to sex is through consent.

also its also a reason why many rape victims consider suicide. society treats women who have been victim of rape as though she is impure and lost her worth. ""esko ta ijjat lutiyo, aba kosle bihe garcha eslai... jindagi barbaad vayo esko"" such statements are thrown at the victims of rape. while the rapists freely live in the society after making some agreements (financials or such), the victims are looked down on as if they are the ones who committed the crime.

while there maybe arguments that more sex may result in more unwanted pregnancies or STDs, proper sex education and use of protections is the proper way to go.

also while strict punishments can reduce the cases to some extent, understanding the root cause may be the way to reduce the cases significantly.

lastly i think the only difference between rape and sex is one simple but most important thing called consent. if the person you intend to have sex with doesn't consent, just don't do it.

PS: i know this maybe a conflicting opinion and its entirely my personal opinion but i think this is something that needs to be discussed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/j5jyuv/does_anyone_else_think_that_sex_as_a_taboo_is_one/,10/5/2020 14:04,43,0,39,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,1,2

18v823w,Need some suggestions to analyse the situation.,"We are a family of five, me, wife, parents and sister. she is recently passed BDS graduate.(26)
The thing is she went to ktm a week back for some official work a week back and was living with some relatives there. Here at pokhara we planned for new year family trip getaway to Manakamana temple and asked her to come to pokhara asap.
She told she would directly join at temple from Kathmandu as she didn't want to travel the same road again. we didn't like the idea and asked her to come pokhara and join us for the trip as it was a family gathering and even gave her option to return through plane. She denied every request of ours and started making lots of excuses as if she has her own plans for new year. We even asked if that was the situation but she insisted on meeting us at the temple. It wasn't a reasonable thing to insist on as it wouldn't be the family trip after all so I asked to return asap in a loud tone over the video call. That's it.The call was suddenly ended and she started ignoring us. She accused us of giving order and she had to comply as if she is a robot.
Later that day she returned to pkr by bus and kept ghosting us. There was no message or phone calls, ignored our calls. She has been sleeping in her room for more than 24 hours. All our plans have been cancelled. 
She even threatened us with suicide as we made her return to pokhara and we didn't listen to her plan.
We tried repeatedly to talk to her but everything was shrugged off every time. 
I suspect she had plans the day we asked her to return and she wasn't ready to accept it.
I don't know how to react or how to analyse this situation. What would be the solution? Was I wrong on this?

x52zgv,I don't have any interesting title,"Idk where to start. I'm always so lonely. I'm a middle child of my family. Its obvious I don't have good relationship with my siblings, not even my parents. The elder one is rich and younger one is a boy child plus younger one is everyone's favourite. I don't have any best friends; I barely have any friend. And my bf wants me to have a friend but I'm different than what he wants me to be.

I'm not so social or maybe people don't socialize my way.

Men have always felt disposable that’s what I’ve heard. Disposable in war, disposable in marriage, disposable in divorce courts. Probably this is why the suicide rate of men is higher than women. Men work the most disgusting and gruesome jobs. Men are the ones going to fight wars to protect the political interests of politicians. I just want to thank men for all of this. You are cherished, loved and appreciated. I do understand that most heinous crimes are also committed by men, the world is run by men and so much more. But men are also the ones who fight against the oppression of other men. Hell, I dated men and they were all amazing. My dad risked everything to raise me and my siblings.

173qipe,What these Nepali songs trying to say?,"Anyone care to describe the meaning of these songs? I tried listening few times but couldn't understand what the artist/songwriter meant to say with those lyrics.

This here (alphabetically)

Aditya AK - Dhamilo

(Sounds like a breakup song mixed with lost in life but meaning?) (Good voice artist need to make more songs)

Forest Anthem - MaruVhumi

(Is it saying a man is lost at nowhere like in desert?) (This is the only song from this band i found)

Kush - Kitadu

(Is it trying to say i have become an insect tangled in the web?) (I haven't found any other songs from them beside this but they used to be somewhat popular?)

Nabis And The Anarchies - Sworga Ki Kaidi

(Meaning a man in despair in the cage trying to flee?) (Another band with less songs)

Rajesh Nepali (ft. Reagon Awale) - Ritto Bhado

(Nail-biting vocal but what is the actual meaning of this song?) (His first Nepali song)

Sambat Shree - Paani

(Looks like a song was written influence by famous quote by Bruce Lee but what is trying to say?) (Another one hit wonder artist it seems so)

Sanso Gurung - Goji maa Haat

(Sounds like an anti-suicide song but still confused and his few songs also don't have clear meaning) (2nd album better than 1st album in terms of lyrics)


Ulto Aaina - Ulto Aaina

(Self-titled itself making it clear but what is the actual meaning of the song? Like a man has seen different wrong path?) (Needs more grunge Nepali songs like this)

s2c3kt,I need to listen to some warm words.,"Hello. I \[M\] am 29 years of age and I feel like everything in my life is going in a downward spiral except a thing or two. I was abused by a neighbor when I was in class 9 which went on for a few years. I have lately realized that it has messed up with my sexuality. I have an inner circle of friends whose constant care and love have made me navigate through my life so far. This is one of the few good things that I have in my life. I am just a high school graduate and this year, I decided to enroll myself in a bachelor’s course which has helped me a lot mentally. I had this disdain over academic studies as I became so frustrated with the whole process in my high school. I was a good student and I think I messed up. I missed out on so many things because of that. Most of my friends are married now and everyone’s starting this new journey in their life which makes me feel left out. I am nearing my 30s which kind of freaks me out. I don’t have any savings as I also have to support my family which I want to change this year. I was having a shower today and I realized how my body has changed a lot in a few years of time. I mean, I didn’t like myself at all and in this process, I didn’t take care of my body which shows, right! I felt so affected by realizing that my face is already wrinkled, I have bald spots and grey hair, plus the belly fat and whatnot. It’s not just the vanity that I am trying to tell but everything just hit me again. I am trying to gather myself by thinking that at least I took a step forward by enrolling in a Bachelor’s course in a decade but that didn’t help. I feel like I have messed up big time. I feel so pathetic in every family gathering. The kiddos in the school earn better by their Instagram’s marketing and online shopping. I am not jealous but everything is taking a toll on me and I really want to do something. Yes, this year, I feel less suicidal but I’m afraid I mightn’t be able to protect myself for long. Why does everything have to be like a checklist? I want to love myself first, fall in love, and explore so many things that life has to offer but it feels like a dead end. As I am nearing my 30s, and with the failure tag in everything, I wonder who would even want to share their life with me! I can't see any purpose of my life. I feel like I am drowning. The feeling of emptiness is just increasing and I can’t share this with anyone in my life. I hope to hear some warm words. I so need a hug. I don’t want to kill myself.

uqw1xp,I just want to RANT about myself,"So what im basically doing is trying to flush out all the pent up felling that i have right now and i want to talk about my personality.

Lets start with my personality shall we. I don,t consider myself a ""normal"" person i usually consider myself a very fucking weird person when compared to others and i don't know in which manner i am weird i just think that i am weird and i have a lot of insecurity and one of the insecurity that drives me crazy and makes me just hate my existence is jealousy and it just seems that i can't get it out of my system. Let me tell about how bad my jealousy has gotten this past year if there is a person a that i like or i seem to like and when that person that i like hangs out with others i just get that tightening feeling in my chest and it just makes me want to vomit.but it doesn't limit to persons only it also apply to in-animate object like laptop, mobile and because of that it makes me so  angry  i cant bear it and it doesnot help the fact that i have anger issues and because of all the elements i just want to smack myself and which leads to self-loathing and other self-depreciative stuffs. Even while writing this i have that tightening feeling and the funny part is that i cant even cry it all out so i can feel light it just builds up and builds up and eventually causes a volcano of emotions i cant control, so far it has only happened once and let me tell you guys it is one of the most terrifying thing i have experienced is my life just imagine every kind of suicidal thought, every kind of existential crisis thought that you can think of right now and multiply it by 10 that is the amount of emotions and thought that i felt in the time period of 1-2 minutes.

iejws4,"Teenager le guff hanyo, kasto cringe.","This might sound weird and a bit exaggerated but have you ever thought how pathetic you are.

While your friends are progressing you sit here browsing reddit and getting suicidal for no fucking reason. All your student life (at least till 10th grade), you tried your best to be a topper, achieve good academically and now you are left with no skills whatsoever except getting anxiety every once in a while! While you know you have a good skill for 
procrastinating stuffs and a unique quality of being left by your so called 'good friends', you dive into senseless shitposting occasionally.

Knowing that the only way to satisfy your parents is to follow what they say and cry when you realize that you never had any ambition, rather you always believed your parents interests to be the best choice for you.

Yet, you go on living, hoping one day things get better.

s0wi6x,"(Off My Chest) Now, that he is dead, I feel like more people should hear it.","I come from a lower-middle-class family in Jhapa. However, most of my relatives are not that fortunate. So, this story is about one relative cousin (M25). I never met him in person, but I have known his family for a long time.

His father was an ex-Maoist militant, who had turned into a drunkard after the peace agreement. (I don't support his decision to join the Maoist) and his mom has been working in an Arab country to earn for their family. Once he became adult enough, he left his studies to work at a restaurant in Kathmandu when he was 18Years Old. After working for around 2 years, the restaurant owner's daughter and he were in love with each other and then decided to elope back to Jhapa. The family was unaware of this. However, the restaurant owner/the girl's father is an influential person, so they intercepted the couple somewhere in Dhading, who used his influence of accusing the guy of human trafficking (I know I can't prove his intentions, but from what I know, that wasn't the case). After 4-6 months of court proceedings, he was sent to 5 years of Jilla karagar in Dhading. He was recently released after completing his term, but he was not him when he returned home. Maybe the interrogation, the torture, or even isolation had weakened him to the point of depression. He committed suicide a week ago, his father was recently saved from a suicide attempt from poisoning.

I have been feeling so humiliated in the society because of that man screaming outside. He says things like 'tero tauko futaidinchu, haddi vachdinchu and I pretend I am not there'. I have tried suicide 3 times but just do not have the guts to go through.
I contacted a lawyer and all he says is 'tapai chinta na garnu, usle tyadto garyo ki afai fascha' but the thing is I do not want to go feel it man wtf does he not understand. I haven't eaten even rs 1 from him and why do I still have to go through with this. I have earned each rupee from my own tears and hardwork and yet I have to go through this psychological pain.
If anyone knows a way to die peacefully please tell me, I am at my last straw. I have given all the money I had to him already and still he keeps on shouting at me.
When I said I would call police, he later on brought police himself and said 'mero pauch kaka cha, taile kei garna sakdainas'.

wc6yti,Why I want to have kids of my own.,"I was quite surprised to see the response from my fellow redditors standing aside of not willing to have offsprings in future. This led me to raise the thought on why I want to have my offsprings. Also, I am not judging anyone, I am judging my own belief. It seems that my belief aligns with the fact that having offspring will give me immense opportunity to re-learn the life process. Well, as much spritual it may sound, crrently I am suffering from existential crisis, I merely know my child-self. Growing around my child will make me teach them so many things in her different stages of life which will eventually rewire my brain cognitive process. Thinking about this, it feels like give and take from a skeptical and self-centered perspective. I have always felt full when I have given what I own and seeing others grow because of my input. So, teaching my kids the things I have learnt shall make me full to life and eventually less suicidal of course. This counteracts the deal of expenses brought by the kids against like how I shouldn't have to pay the bills of my mental health treatment. But the thing is, weather my kids will feel the same about their kids ? Or, will I be able to hold this belief ? Well its a mystery I guess, time shall unfold the answer.

en7ubl,Asking for a friend,"Its a question to everyone 
I am seeking for a suggestion

I will make it short and understanding.

Actually i am 23 year old boy who came to japan as like many others for a good future. I came as a student 
then accidentally i meet this girl in nepal when i return back to holidays . I came back to japan after sometime we got connected in facebook and started talking and all. Then after i started thinking of her to the future or as a wife. I was deeply truely over her. And as a boyfriend or as a lover i wanted to make her dream turn possible. And her dream was to go abroad and do something for her family which was a good thing . Then i tried for my working visa cause if i got working visa i could marry my lover her and complete her dream i mean to take her here with me and she could also do something for her family and we will live happily. But THE RESULT was not coming as i waited for 3-4 months. I was able to live in japan but also i decided to quit and return nepal so that i can apply for australia and take her also together. Then i returned to nepal joined for ielts class and started processing for australia . Between those times i was spending time with her good time quality time . I never felt that she was showing fake or whatever she was doing was just an act . Then one day i suddenly get a call from japan . My lawyer called me on messenger and said your working visa has been granted you have to come withing one week . There was limited time and fixed time if i decide to return japan and stay on working visa.
After that i called my girlfriend and told her everything i told my parents too. At that time my gf was in her hometown i asked what to do 
I just have limited days so if we have to marry we should make it soon and i will go and apply for you too after three months. As lack of time for now we will do a simple paper marriage and all and after that after returning from japan after two years we will give grand party and all. She my family everyone was ok with it. She came the next day to ktm . She was alone when my parents asked anyone with you she said right now its a teej time its just busy at home so no one was able to come and i have told all to my family . We were like ok i mean why would she lie to us after all she was my girlfriend and before thay i had talked to her sister and father too. Then we had small function tika program in my home my family members were there we were really happy . I felt a little bit sad for her because she was alone she had no one i felt really bad and my respect and love for her was increasing after seeing that things too.
Then i came to japan i applied for her
Her visa was also granted . It was her first experience to go outside country so i was really worried for her. Will she be ok in transit cause INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS of other country are not as like same of nepal . They are big huge and its really quite hard and panic moment for a first time traveller. So i requested my company for a leave and i took 4 days leave and i just flew back nepal to pick her. The day i reached nepal i had a plan for meeting betweeb two families too. I requested her father each and everyone to come but they were like sorry we wont be able to come they showed some serious reasons . She and her elder sister was there and again my family members. Then we came back to japan . I was really happy and feeling proud of myself that yes i have done it
Finally i have made my loves’ dream come true. I had a feeling that yes i deserve her and was really excited for upcoming days to spend as husband and wife . But things were not going as i thought. I see changes on her behavior on her face . I don’t see her happy the satisfaction on her face . At first i thought it was because she had just left nepal her family and friends thatswhy she may be behaving like that . But one day i find her phone on . I mean I HAD NEVER LOOKED OR ASKED FOR her phone or messages and all cause i was never hoping that she would be cheating or there can be something behind .  After returning from work when i was trying to sleep and remove blanket i saw her phone on . I never had intention to look her phone or check but it was on that time may be she just felt asleep while texting or chatting.
When i looked inside i found chatting with a guy there was everything love you and all . Not only that their facebook password was also being shared . I was schocked i mean I couldn’t imagine that the person whom i have loved so much respected trusted so much could even do this. Then i couldn’t even scroll all the messages and look. I was blank and i just locked up the phone and start thinking what to do what not to do?? I also had thought of MURDER OR SUICIDE . Then after i waited for next day i talked to her i asked for everything she was like nothing there is nothing . She had no answer of any question. She said directly it was not a marriage its a just paper marriage. I came here for my family. What?? Paper marriage ?? Whether its love or arranged or court  MARRIAGE IS A MARRIAGE ITS A PURE RELATIONSHIP. Ok to think of your family its ok but for your family to play with me with my family’s trust and everything. Its not a good thing . But also i said her its ok PAST IS PAST . Let’s continue lets think of future from now . BUT SHE WAS LIKE NO
SHE CANT
I never said her you cheated me so you have to obey me from now you have to do whatever i said and all
I left her thinking that she will understand my love she will feel the love that how much i like her how much i wanna be with her BUT NO .
She was like NO . This proved that she never had loved me cause any third person will fall in love after seeing all this love and dedication. Then i felt like i lost and i said ok then let’s divorce 
You on your own way and me i will also start new life. But she was not ready for divorce too .. its not because she loves me and she wanted to be with me but its with the fear of losing visa to stay here which was very bad thought and very bad doing. She left we were separated but legally was not divorced she was contactless she blocked me on social media and all I didn’t have her number too. Then i applied for a case in NEPAL for divorce . As we all know nepal kanun it was a long process but also i had no choice beside that . NOW before one month i found that she was in NEPAL . Its look like she was sent to NEPAL as she was illegal here cause she came here in my dependent. Then after going nepal she has filed case against me saying that she wants MONEY ( ANSA) which i was expecting. Cause her motive was to be here in japan and earn money which was not successful and now after returning nepal divorce is final. Its what she wants too but she wants to take money whatever how much she can from me through divorce which is again her next wrong step. Like this she is committing wrong and wrong things again and again and i am not going to give her a single ruppee now cause she doesn’t deserve it. If calculating she have to pay me 15/20 lakhs but i dont need money too . All i want is justice . I will fight till my last breathe if decision is not suitable i will go to higher court and all . Why after everything is proved girl is wrong why again we male have to give them money even if they are wrong??

yu15lg,Ma esto geet gauchu 2 - a movie about a physcopath who killed a hooker for organ harvesting,"So, i watched Ma esto geet gauchu 2 on youtube. The movie is rated 6.8/10, previous installation was 7.1/10. 

The movie is about a established singer and a fan girl.  i felt that this movie is ""A start is born"" but in ratnapark. 

Basically, Paul hears song of the gaule girl, comes after her in her gaun. after sometimes return to Kathmandu. However, stardom of Paul as singer is fading, desperate for stardom, he steal girl's song while calling her in KTM for recording.

Butthurt, that he stole her song - girl attempts suicide however is saved just in time. But due to some neck injurie in attempted suicide, her vocal cord is damanged and she isn't able to speak. 

Paul is guilt ridden. Consults doctor what can be done. doctor suggests transplant of vocal chord, some doctor from US will come for this surgery. 

Paul goes to Pasupati for organ donor like a person goes to Kalimati for sagpaat, however is chased away by family of dead. At this time, Paul is desperate. He goes to night bar and hear a girl singing song beautifully, same song he stole. She is part-time hooker and part-time bar singer. 

Paul lure the girl into his room promising to pay shitton of money. Paul tells his intention and ask her to donate her vocal chord. however, girl refused, paul in return kills that girl. her vocal chord is transplanted to gaule girl. now she is able to speak and sing like before. gaule girl is unknow about this.

Paul incourage gaule girl to be singer and tell her you are singer. Paul manages to organize concret for her. But there is no paul. later paul's manager tells her everything paul did to restore his voice. everyone is melted by what paul did. gaule girl goes to stage and sings a song as paul is escorted by cops. the movie ends with gaule girl saying 'i love you paul'.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/yu15lg/ma_esto_geet_gauchu_2_a_movie_about_a_physcopath/,11/13/2022 13:06,8,0,5,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,0,1,0,0,0

* Is it because of his popular and meaningful rap songs like Sathi?
* Is it because he created and hosted the rap battles (Raw Barz) and brought the idea to the masses?
* Is it because he committed suicide and is no longer with us?

Now, I know singers like Narayan Gopal have statue(s) in popular areas. Has Yama Buddha earned the same respect with the public?

qki4u6,No cases of PTSD of our world war and other war veterans?,"Whenever we open American media, PTSD of their war veterans is a hot topic. The problem is so much prevalent that the suicide of their veterans is 7 times higher than national average, their issue is a topic of presidential election.

On the other hand, we rarely hear any news of PTSD of our war veterans. I have never heard any such case of veterans dying to suicide.

Why is it so? What might be the reasons that these our veterans seem to handle war more smoothly compared to Americans.

Before anyone comments because mental health is a taboo here and we don't talk about it. I'd like to say that if our veterans were dying to suicide proportionally higher than normal folks, it would have obviously made news either by veteran organizations, national or international media or NGOs. On the other hand, we see our veterans living a normal life dying to old age. So, there must be something else.

Even if you are just message anyone you know because I know what it feels like to be left out everytime for the past 13 years of my life not living just surviving and I am tired of this. I have nobody to check me out but they have you and you never know you may have someone. Just make their day.

Simple but really nice. Sheesh, These days there is just this feeling of despair, like i am never going back to that state. The feeling of despair sucks k, it feel like a recipe for perpetual sadness. When ever my mind is free there is just this frequent bout of sadness and anxiety. Sometimes it just goes up and up till i feel physically sick. Kaile kai ta roidum ki jasto ni lagxa. But again like chimps, i can't cry for some reasons. I sleep it off, it works. And don tell me to seek professional help. Gym kinda has been therapeutic to me. It helps me regulate my emotions. I get out of gym feeling better and energetic then going in. It's weird. Sometimes, i feel so sick that I don't think i would be able to workout. My body is all weak and chilled. But i go to gym. First half hour is miserable but then like a switch is turned and i feel effing amazing.

Past week or so, ni i went back to my old addiction of watching tv series and movies. Fck i am doing delving in escapism again. I felt like moping. i thought a little bit if moping was necessary. But it has turned into procasination. And again the effing tomorrow fallacy. Fck! I don't feel like doing things that needs to be done.
I need to feel my prospective memory with some productive stuff. Seems like only way to live a freaking happy life. This past few weeks have triggered some old neural pathways that makes me indolent as fck.  Fck i might never just feel good about just existing in peace.

tmgon7,Brutal conditions of little students,"Rajesh Sedhai from Galaxy Public School was once accused of untying a girl's bra of a girl from Class 8 so was demoted to teaching students in Grade 2 and 3. Besides this, he used to beat kids half to death for very minor reasons including me. There were lots of teachers just like him and they would do it just for fun. Teachers would laugh around, boast around about beating kids. Pretty much 80% of the teachers were sadists.   


There's a DI named Marich, who was the worst of them all. He picked on students for absolutely no reason and beat the absolute crap out of kids just for walking without confidence. He preyed on the weak the most. The school was a living hell, every single teacher was a nightmare. Their process was to make the students disciplined is by torturing them, but the thing I realized here was, students were much more out of control and much more willing to make mistakes. It had become such a regular thing that all the beatings were normalized.   


The teachers here deserve jail time. There must be done a serious investigation on these savages.   
I recommend anyone who is sending their kids to this school, must immediately take their kids out.   


I even tried suicide because I feared the teachers and a lot of ongoing home situations. Thankfully, I survived. I was only 14. Please share awareness.

el88rp,How do we stop Homophobia and transphobia in nepal? (Its the year 2020!),"Studies show that LGBT people show higher levels of anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings than heterosexual men and women. These mental health conditions can be linked to, or caused by, hostility or rejection from family parents and friends, bullying and name-calling at school, danger of violence, casual homophobia and negative portrayal of gay people in the media.

Sex education classes should be given after completing kindergarten as the earlier we can combat homophobia the better.
If we can teach schoolchildren that its nothing wrong with being gay or trans at a young age, we can prevent them from being homophobic or heterosexual.

Since there are more than 50 genders now (http://thepbhscloset.weebly.com/a-list-of-genders--sexualities-and-their-definitions.html) we should have schools do surveys on which spectrum of genders does their students feel they are on. There should also be a choice for trans students to freely choose whichever male or female toilet they can use.

We can prevent homophobia, discrimination and prejudice developing if we catch it early enough. This is why it’s vital to start educating children at primary and junior age, teaching them about equality and diversity, and introducing equality lessons which cover LGBT+ themes in an age appropriate way. We must teach new generations to respect one another, regardless of preferred identity or orientation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/el88rp/how_do_we_stop_homophobia_and_transphobia_in/,1/7/2020 7:25,5,0,19,English,0,0,1,0,0,0

njh33o,"Nepali dating show, it's stupid as hell. But why?","Ok, this isn't a real dating show, but more of a staged entertainment show dressed as a dating show.

But I just want to know why and how?

And more important, I am asking my self why a normal person would join this show to harm their image and if unlucky becoming an internet meme for life.

Specially in this marriage and understanding orientated backward society we have. I fear for the future of the lady contestants. Why would they want to damage their image as lobi, hypocritical, gold digger, blind, sluty person.

Wait wait wait, before you say something else, this could be a door to the big entertainment industry and make them future movie and serial stars, and BTW how many peoples had to sell their body with directors, etc. to become the popular artist they are today. But how many of the not very good-looking or talented contestant would be big after this show because of this in the coming 10 years?

Don't they think that if they become known with this before marriage that even marriage will be hard, and that they will be followed by this and will be looked bad because of this and have to live shitty life for a long time? Specially in their after marriage close family. Where the close relative and the further relatives will be happy they have a big subject to gossip around. And feel they are important cuz they have something unusual to say.

Because for example in INDIA cast etc. is higher. But compared to India, Nepal has a society which is a pain in the ass if they have something bad to tell about you. And a society which in the worst case have more power to kill people with suicide. It's not about suicide, its just because of relatives, society and geography, and low understanding of peoples. /And the fact that there are lots of jobless peoples that have to screw each others/ Specially if you are a woman, our samajh make them hard to live, there are countless innocent woman who's lives got wrecked cuz 1 or 2 people didn't like them and our samajh 1 by 1 followed them to the point all people were looking down  on that person for no reason.

There are countless stories that made Women's life a narg, even situations where women's were cheated, left by partners etc. They were shocked to death for about a week, but it was the kura katni and tarpera bachna banuane samajh that made their year or decades a narg. Even when it's not about you, it is your life that is getting shattered by fake story gossiped by the society. It's a society that knows everyone very well and very good and combined with low understanding no one is left, specially if you are more vulnerable, and specially when you are more vulnerable your life could be harmed more by the fake stories flying around our society. For example, son vs daughter, and rich dad's daughter vs poor dad daughter's.

Nepal and India are similar, but for example the relation with neighbors and neighborhood is better in Nepal, but the drawbacks because of our low minded peoples in matters where it matter is low, i am talking about matters where intelligence or education doesn't have a role just good and right understanding and behavior is what is needed. Also in India, not everyone knows everyone very well like in Nepal, and also in Nepal aru ko pura history kina tha pauna parni? Also Nepal ma kam na vako aunty ra ali budo uncle tanai 6an.

Back to the matter. So for god say's, why would any unmarried women who aren't in emergency situation to save someone life or similar for money, joining this stupid show.

And why and how did this show to existence. When a normal or different, new type of real dating show could have come to existence!?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/njh33o/nepali_dating_show_its_stupid_as_hell_but_why/,5/23/2021 20:58,6,0,8,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,0,2

Many of us don’t come from rich nor wealthy families. When you ask a majority of Nepali students, you will hear many of them say I want to study aboard, which is understandable. Still, many also failed to understand what it entails we all have dreams and aspirations, and we try to get there at any cost with that it led us to make irrational decisions without thinking about the ramification may entail. To everyone that’s trying to study aboard during the fall season and these uncertain times, Ask your self this question is it worth it to go to college aboard for (10k-50k) for online classes? Is it worth it to take out massive loans for online courses?  As previously mentioned, we don’t have Jeff Bezos as our parents. Is it worth it to but your parents through that financial burden? Most Nepali parents want what best for there children even if it means funding your international studies even tho they know they are not able to. I  will conclude it by asking no I’m discouraging you from studying abroad but try to be more pragmatic than optimistic if you want to study abroad try for spring semester rather than fall as the world works to get back to normal.

They informed me that a student sumitted an exact copy of my assessment and if I knew him at all. I didn't know him nor remember giving any of the student my assessment. So, I denied of giving or knowing him. It wasn't one portion but whole 130 pages of my assessment. He just edited out my name from the cover page. Now, the college is prosecuting both of us since the person who gave and who copied are both at fault. I am not denying my part since I uploaded it in the study resource website called coursehero. Prior to this, the college also warned us to not upload or give any of the study material. After they called me, I instantly removed all of my content from that website but it wasn't easy since CourseHero have all the authority to not remove it even though the original creator wants to.

There was a similar case where the student was hold off graduating for a year. I want some opinions",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/wt1k1l/i_am_so_stressed_out_right_now/,8/20/2022 7:55,29,0,32,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

flq35p,"Had my first accident 2 days ago(March 18) and now, I am getting stressed because of it and its consequences. I need general as well as legal advice.","So Hi, I am currently living in Dhapakhel, I am 23(Male), studying Bachelors 4th year@Patan Multiple Campus.
I was going from Satdobato-Ekantakuna, the accident happened at Mahalaxmi sthan chowk morning 8ish tira.. The woman(on her scooter) was crossing the road(coming from lagankhel and going towards Nakhipot). My speed was around 65ish maybe. And I hit her scooter's back portion(around engine area). I was on bike(200 NS) mild scratches on both bike and scooter, nothing so serious. More on this later.

So, I took her on her scooter to nearest hospital which is Ganesh Man Memorial Hospital. There was X-ray of her foot. Which was swollen(nilo pani vako thyo, very small spot), X-ray said no fractures no bone issues. (I was so relieved).

She then said, she hit her head and is hurting. So the nurse checked and said it was swollen a bit(tutilo). Then the doctor suggested that if you have dizziness, Vomiting, etc then there will be need for CT scan or something. To check the internals of the head(maybe).

The total cost of medicines and checkup was around 1800(which is not much, could have been way worse). tablets, Xray, blood test, bandages, malham etc.
One thing to mention she paid for chiya, nasta for her relatives. I thought she was quite good person. More on this later.
So we went to Traffic office@Satdobato and agreed to Me paying for her ""Ausadhi Upachar"", we didn't specified any dates (will this be an issue, the traffic didn't even asked if there was need for date limit, so I don't know about this). After that I went to her home on the day of accident after agreeing to the terms she offered tea, I accepted. After a bit talk I went to my home(vada ko room).

Yesterday we just talked on viber, she said come to her house, I said I'll be available only after 5 PM and then she said she won't be home at that time.
So we didn't meet yesterday.

Today(March 10), I was at college, she calls and tells me to come, I said I am at college, she then says ""tapaiko time vaye matra huni hora"" with a tone, and she hangs up, I was so angry. I rush to her home she was walking fine at that time (swelling was reduced), 

she showed me scratches on her scooter (which was both sides) and said ""tapai le hanera malai eta ladaunu vo yeta ko sticker tapai le ferdinu paryo, uta ko ma afai tirxu"". She showed me her helmet, helmet ko glass adkauni lock vachya raixa, in her words ""ma yo helmet ma lade, ma yo helmet lagaudina, tapaile naya kindinu paryo"". I told her that yo tw lock thik gare vaihalxa, she insisted on her previous comment.

Then after all this, I went inside the room(she was also living in the vada ko room, her home is at Nawalparasi), she offered me tea I refused. I said I already had (I hadn't). And now she tells me she was forgetting alot, talking alot, and her head was hurting. She was able to move her head slowly just fine. And asked for MRI of the head ( I don't even know how much does the MRI cost). 

Before(at the day of accident) the doctor said that if she vomits, ringata(dizzy) feel vayo vane CT scan garauna parxa vanera. So I said if you aren't vomiting, dizzing, then just rest for 2-3 days it will be fine. 

I said I am a student my father doesn't earn much (I haven't even told him about this, nor planning to), and told her that she was putting me in a difficult position financially.

She then shows her ring, (Chandi ko ring with ""Neelam"" gem); tells me that this cost me 50k, in her words ""ma lad da yo ring ko patthar scratch vo ma yo ni tirauna sakxu tapailai, maile yo ta mageko xaina ni"", I was so mindfucked.

I am worried, stressed about this whole situation.
Thank you for reading all this. Any advice would be of great help.

Edit: I don't own the bike. It's my friend's.

Edit2: The day after yesterday(mar 20) night, I told her, I am a student I can't afford your demands (new helmet, stickers from ""showroom"" because she bought from there 2 years ago) etc. Then ""she was like who sent you to kill me?"", ""Ta sala kukur"" etc.
After that I haven't got any calls from her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/flq35p/had_my_first_accident_2_days_agomarch_18_and_now/,3/20/2020 6:18,19,0,47,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,0,2

178ixvu,too embarassed to be myself,"i really apologize in advance for this very long vent. 

18F here. i am so scared to even write about this. i really dont know how to put this but im uncomfortable trying to be myself. i feel like i am too simple to fit in and feel like i come off as a boring person. not an introvert or anything, i consider myself as 90% extroverted but i just dont feel like i belong anywhere or dont know where people like me stand or should be going. like i dont do stuffs and keep up with the trends that teenagers these days do. im really having a hard time expressing this because i dont know what situation you call this. i have 2 genuine people who are 'actual' friends to me and besides them, others are just people i 'talk' to or know at least. not like i struggle approaching people rather there are VERY few people i resonate with. i am not someone who's fascinated by movies or series or things of that sort nor am actively using social media. i barely even take photos of myself because i dont know, it's just pointless to me sometimes and there are situations when people show me what they've got in their phones, and it gives me particularly unusual feeling when people my age show me photos they've taken of themselves and things like that and it's just soo embarassing when i have nothing to show to them and always have to hit them with the ""i am not photogenic haha"" which is very awkward and sometimes i feel like people cringe on me for that. same for when i am hanging out with bunch of my girl friends and they've got trendy topics to share within themselves and i feel very excluded. not like they ignore me or anything but i just don't think i have much to bring in to the plate. specially when they start taking group photos or making tiktoks, i instantly withdraw myself because i dont know what to do at that moment. everyone's vibing and all and here's me, not hyped up. this is why i dont really hang out with people except for two of my friends. those two were my schoolmates whom im still friends with and since all 3 of us went to different colleges, i particularly had a hard time fitting in. people tried bringing up topics to converse with me ani it was specially about social media stuffs and the kind of movies and series i was interested into. not to mention i don't even watch movies much except for a particular genre which people don't really watch. i dont know why the heck i am so simple i mean girls my age they're all having the time of their life, going out on weekends, dancing, clubbing and all, wearing flashy dresses which is something i want to be doing as well but when it comes to actually doing all that, i feel like i am not made for all that. not like i have a fear of missing out or something but i think i am not the person people really would want to invite when it comes to the idea of 'having fun'. i see girls my age having so much fun and here's me who doesn't even try. i do NOTHING at all. i am here helping my mum with chores and all during weekends while there is everyone out there who's having so much fun in their life, doing things people of that age generally do. even when it comes to dating and all, i mean i've had fair luck with dating and relationships but it's just that i am very conservative even in this aspect. i've even had guys ghosting me because i was not open to the idea of sexting. i have very unusual hobbies as well, i've recently gotten into gardening, i journal and i do arts, play with beads, embroideries and all. it was not an issue of concern until i realised i fit in NOWHERE AT ALL. i don't really find myself boring, i think i am a unique person and i find myself very precious but sometimes, you just want to fit in, you know. it's ironical how two of my friends are relatively less reserved but i am just so comfortable around them and it's also not like i should only be hanging out with them and only them because even they have different friend groups besides ours but when it comes to me, ultimately they're the only people i talk to. some people even jokingly made fun of me for this but i took it personally because that's how i have exactly always felt but now that they bring that up, i take it as a confirmation and not something i make up in my head. all this may also be because i had a stressful upbringing and i have emotionally abusive parents so i have pretty much been with myself and i myself was the only person i've looked upto all these years. i have no idea why i am letting out all this here but i also want to know how common is it to be like this? it's not like i hate being like this, but as social beings, you gotta socialize because you can't always be by yourself and we live in a society and i absolutely love the idea of meeting new people. but i just feel like an outsider and i noticed how i am starting to slowly withdraw from people and society because of the same, have come to the point where i feel like it's embarassing to be me and you can only be a particular somebody to really fit in. not like i am not willing to compromise and step out of my comfort zone to do so, but i just don't want to be doing all that just for the sake of fitting in. 
so what exactly do you call this situation and how common is it to be like this?

1frv4l4,What is the state of land ownership in Nepal?,"Hi friends,

I’m Nepali who has lived abroad from a young age and my parents have sold off all properties in Nepal long time ago except 1 block of land in case they ever wish to go back and build a small house.

The thing is they are slowly realising that they probably won’t be moving back to Nepal after retirement anyway so no point in keeping the land. My father got an offer of 15 lakh per aana on 12.5 aana land in this area called bhaisepaty.

He can comfortably retire if he sells it for this amount and live stress free without a loan here. The problem is greed. My thulobaba and all other family members discouraged my dad for selling it for that price saying this will go up way more per anna in a few years and he should wait.

My father isn’t getting any younger, he will be 60 next year and I just want to see him relax now after working his whole life. I tell him this but he always says “talai dherai tha chha ki mero dai lai” which is true I really don’t know if it’s the truth that the price will skyrocket in a few years or not and no one has a crystal ball.

I don’t know much about real estate in Nepal, all I’ve heard is that it’s very volatile. Just wanted to ask fellow Nepalis in Nepal what they think about the state of land ownership. 

Appreciate your input saathi 

Edit: For reference the land does not have any road connected to it and the only way to get to it is through a small walkway.

1dbpv95,So many jobs available yet Nepalese won't do it,"There are so many job vacancies in Nepal yet Nepalese (esp. youngsters) won't do it. Job vacancies mostly on these fields - Hotels, Security, Retail, even cleaners etc. Here are the main reasons why Nepalese don't/won't work in their own country.

1. Pride - too much pride, one you are from middle class, other being educated at high level results/subject/college

2. Ego - Low level jobs you don't consider a job but then you are still one of those who bargain heavily at cheap price to even buy one pair of socks or to buy fruits from street vendor.

3. Complain - too much blah blah, this good, this bad

4. Judge - Judging without actually knowing by yourself

5. Comparison - Comparing between yourself and other, Nepal and Overseas, Gender, Class, Education etc.

6. Mindset - Your mindset is puzzled, you rely on others, make decision based on strangers, social media even though some do advice greatly but when something goes wrong, you start to blame/hate them.

7. Nepali society - you work hard on your study, you learn lot of things and even experience few things, you know what's right, what's wrong, you speak highly of yourself behind the screen, you think your thoughts are better, you think others don't have much knowledge than you. Most Nepalese youngsters are very smart, well educated, yet they cannot take action due to the surroundings of Nepali society around them. 

My parents did not let me do that, what will my neighbor think? What will my friends/relative think? If I start to work as a cleaner or security guard when my field is IT but I haven't got job, it's hard, so much stress, life sucks! Blah! Blah! But you have found the cleaning/sales assistant/security guard job yet you won't do. All because of above reason and many more. Same jobs, you do it abroad, not just because of good pay but you totally can let go those above points because you are not in Nepal.

Note: after reading some comments, the only thing you can think of is low pay? Instead of being jobless and wandering around hopeless expecting easy money or even free money from your relatives from overseas, Why don't you work at these low pay jobs first until you find the proper one you think?

Low pay jobs, what an easy excuse! It's Nepal, Hello! What are you expecting? See now you are comparing, that is one of the point above mentioned clearly and is one of the reason you just don't want to work but blah blah!

Harassment by employers? It's everywhere in this world. If you are jobless, you work whatever you find to feed your family, even if it's just too little to cover the expenses but at least you get that little amount rather than not getting anything by being jobless. Then you keep looking for better pay job while still working on low pay job!

These Nepalese people really think highly of themselves, pride? Ego? But then same people bargain at street vendor is such a two faced. You can also work as a street vendor if you haven't found the job yet but you can't! Well the problem for not getting job is not due to country Nepal but yourself!

1bqu4pm,Should I continue my father's legacy?,"I 28M is a 2nd generation pharmacist in my family. We have an almost 40 years old community pharmacy which is generating a decent income of 30-60K per day. After completing my graduation, I joined my family business and working along side my father. Being born and brought up in an environment surrounded with medicine, I was in love with medicine from an early age. To be working along side by father from whom I learned the basics is truly surreal. My dad has an experience of 40+ years and has earned quite a reputation in my community where he has served almost 3-4 generation of single family. Now same is expected from me. Duty starting from almost 7-8 am in the morning to 6-7 pm in the evening. Lately I have not been able to enjoy the monotonous life I have which is very demanding and stressful at times. 

For those who don't know, community pharmacist has more duty and requires more clinical knowledge compared to other pharmacist working in different sectors. During college days was among the bright students in class and I prepared myself for accordingly for the service I had to provide which my dad was doing. Since my college days I had an aspiration to be a pharmacist working abroad  and started to prepare for PBEC exam (an examination board of Canada) back then. Now having worked for 3 years I started to have that inner calling about my college dream to be an pharmacist working abroad as I have gained more clinical knowledge. As I told this to my father he wasn't sure how to react as his only son is not ready to continue what he has started. He is getting old and is over 60+. Having worked for so many years he was sure that I would continue as it is a reputed job with good income. Now after acknowledging my dream, being the great father he is, he proposed me to sell the pharmacy off as he is too tired of working himself and wants the freedom of work free life. 

My father is supportive as I believe it to be. Am I being too ambitious as I have a good lifestyle and financially sound apart from the hectic life that I have. I'm confident that I can pass the exam for which I have taken the decision to attempt it. I have started to have mixed feelings lately. I hope I won't regret this in future.
Am I being a good son?

1acanfz,How do you make a decision?,"How do you make a decision regarding choosing a person and marriage? This is in terms of being serious and with intention to marry and not casual relationships.

I have been struggling so much with this. It’s not about not having people but actually making the decision and committing. Sometimes I feel like just making that decision, choosing a person and not caring about anything but then again I think that it’s not a decision to make like that and it’s a decision for life.

It’s so ironic. It might just be the biggest decision of your life and that very thought makes it so difficult. But stressing too much about it makes it harder to make that decision and keeps you from pursuing other goals in life.

Writing in English just because its easy to express. I finished my bachelor in civil engineering 1 year ago  tu 75batch. I had four back left at end of my 4th year. I thought i would find a job or atleast an internship. But after a year i am still rotting in my room. Sent resume to more than 50 vacancies. None of them gave a single reply. Just a reply saying ""not selected"" would have been much much better. Don't even know they have checked my emails. Tried known contact, all of them said ""cv pathairaaakha milyo bhane bhanxu"". Called nunbers of consultancies, got same reply. I tried to compose myself saying ""back bhayera napako ho ki"". But seeing other having 15+ backs working, i am not composed. I have became so hopleess. I don't even get chance to prove myself. My confidence lvl have gone to 0. I have been distancing my self from my friends and family member lately because i fell so down whenever i am in social gathering. Whenever friend talk about there job and relatives ask about my status , i feel so miserable. Though i haven't got pressure from my family i cant even look into their eyes properly. They have too much expectations from me. i have built so much pressure myself. I have loan of 3lakh that i took for my studies. My family is sahakari pidit. They lost all their savings. Due to it my family doesn't seems like family anymore but lets not go their. I have attempted my backlogs, i think it will be cleared in this attempt. I still have license exam to give it will take about 6 months as it seems.  I don't think i can stay unemployed till then. Now only choice i have is to visit consultancies don't know how practical it is (plz share your opinion). Or do any other jobs (dont think my dad will support in this). I am starting to loose myself. I tear up whenever i think about it. Dont know how to handle this. Writing this so can relieve stress. So many negative thoughts came too my mind lately.

She doesn't reply to my texts. Leaves me on seen. Our chats look like I'm trying to water a dead plant. She's all alone there and  wouldn't even talk to me. How much unwanted should I've been to her. The frustrating part is I don't know what's going on in her life. Where she lives,what she studies, where does she work, her university.I thought we were really close. I ask my parents about how she's doing. She must be really busy but I'm afraid we'll lose connection like my mom lost with her siblings who are abroad for 10+ years.

After researching on social media, listening to neighbors / relatives, I find it’s a lot of work and extra full time job to build house from scratch. If you do it yourself by employing contactor, even more works and stress. 

I find it’s best to give this job to the professionals and not have to worry about each and every tiny step of the process.

I found few companies like skill sewa, lal purja, property Nepal  and so on. They are active on social media and actually seem to be doing good job. They actually do the design, estimate the cost, help select the materials based on our need, procure materials in agreed price, government paperwork and interior as needed and so on. Of course, we as customer will make sure materials and design are examined at least visually inspecting every week.


Do your guys have recommendations based on your experiences on which companies actually do good job from start tot the finish ? Obviously they will charge some 3-10% fees just for doing this.

Its so freaking frustrating to see ""riders"" speeding on their ""150cc beast with raw power"". I can't fucking stress this enough: ""DON'T SPEED"". I nearly got into accident thrice in a span of 5 mins in the stretch from Tinkune to Maitighar only because some idiots were weaving through traffic at crazy speeds. Maybe it was my fault riding at speed limit in a straight line inside my lane. (/s) Where the fuck do you bring that kind of overconfidence from or do you have some cheat code enabled? Also, your bike doesn't have ""exhaust note"" don't rev like idiots at the red light. And for the love of god, stay in your own fucking lane. 

You're not a racer nor do you have the experience of one to lean in the corners or have the safety gears in case things go out of hand. Your polycarbonate helmet will break on the very first impact, your paper thin gloves with fake armor paddings will tear as soon as your hand lands to break the impact, you don't have any armour on your body to absorb impacts of debris that land all over, your 150cc monster probably lacks ABS that you didn't get to save that sweet cash, your ripped jeans will not be the only thing ripped on your body. The moment you make a mistake, you are on your luck.

1gutdgx,Stuck in My Career Journey: Need Advice on What to Do Next,"Hey everyone,

I’m a computer engineering student from the 2074 batch. After a long struggle with back exams, I faced them a couple of months ago, and I think I’ll pass (fingers crossed 🤞). So, one side of my life is (hopefully) getting sorted, but the other side – my career – feels like it’s falling apart, and I really need some guidance.

**Here’s where I’m coming from:**  
I interned for 6 months and worked for 7 months as a junior backend developer at a company in Lalitpur. It was my first job, and honestly, it wasn’t great for my growth. The company had its own product, and my role was just fixing bugs in it. That’s all I did for 7 months – no exposure to planning, developing, deploying, or maintaining a website from scratch. I didn’t learn how to build something; I just patched things. I started learning programming (PHP, Laravel) during the internship, but that’s about it.

After 7 months, they let me go, saying they had “company problems” and “too many employees.” To be fair, it worked out for me because I wasn’t growing there anyway, and I had to focus on my back exams.

Now, it’s been 5 months since then, and I’m still unemployed. Those 5 months? Here’s how they went:

* 2 months went into giving my back exams.
* 2 months were spent refreshing my mind – I visited my sister’s place, spent time with loved ones, and celebrated Dashain and Tihar.
* The last month? Honestly, it was just wasted.

Now, I’m feeling stuck. I’m weak in frontend stuff (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and not even that strong in PHP and Laravel. Here’s what’s eating me up:

1. Should I join a full-stack development course that promises placement after 3 months? I feel like I need proper guidance to actually learn things this time.
2. Should I just focus on PHP and Laravel, brush up my skills on my own, and start looking for jobs again this month?

The thing is, I really need to start earning soon, but I also feel like I don’t have enough skills to land a decent job. I’m so confused and honestly quite stressed about my future.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Or can you share some advice on what I should do next? Any help would mean a lot!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1gutdgx/stuck_in_my_career_journey_need_advice_on_what_to/,11/19/2024 9:31,5,0,6,English,1,0,1,1,0,0

So, this time around, I gave my best and perhaps the final shot. I got into a really good university and received some great scholarships too. It was all fun and games until the whole visa fiasco started. Visa slots weren't available and I was stuck. I spent months waiting for visa slots only to miss them or just get unlucky every single time. Those days of uncertainty were probably some of the worst I had. It was especially harder seeing people go to Australia and Canada while I was stuck at a tipping point. I had planned everything only for it to not work out. I felt stuck with nowhere to go. At last, I did give my interview, and safe to say I got the visa. 

This time, I am going to a university I really like. It seems like a great place both academically and everything else considered. I thought I would be over the top about getting a visa but I was not. However, I was definitely at peace and relief. I can sleep at night without overthinking the whole night way. It feels good to have this level of peace. What I have learnt is that hard work and patience goes a long way. Sometimes, life doesn't turn out the way we want it to but that's okay. One motto that kept me through days of uncertainty after the visa rejection is that ""better days await. Someday, I will look back and laugh that I was stressing about this."" And better days did come. 

Well, this is just the beginning. I have 4 years of gruesome undergrad left but right now, I am glad that I have finally stepped inside the room. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/15co5yb/this_is_just_the_beginning/,7/29/2023 9:43,75,0,29,English,1,0,1,1,1,1
sgb2ll,"Baldness, self-respect, and confidence","Hey all, I am a 23 Male. Just wanted to share my story of going though baldness at an early age. I first remember losing hair when I was 18, I basically ignored it then because it was just a few strands, the number of strands increased as I went to the US to study. Ali dherai stress pani thiyo and genetics ma pani baldness cha. I consulted various doctors who prescribed medication but it did not work. I gave up. Slowly my hairline receded and so did my confidence. I used to stay in my apartment for multiple days. I would always wear a hat when going outside. The most painful was when I visited Nepal once every year. People and relatives used to point it out. Even got teased by some fucking road kids. It was horrible. Pailai dekhi introvert, I was never in a relationship and people were so harsh as to tell me that no one would like me and I would not find anyone…ever. Nepali society is fucked up. My relatives used to spread nonsense facts about me and it was further stressing me out. It was about two years ago when I said enough is enough, I grabbed all the hats I had bought to hide my head and donated them. Then grabbed the razer and clean shaved my head. Oh my god, it felt amazing I raised my head high it was sparkling and the scalp felt like a baby’s skin. That was when I looked into the mirror and appreciated myself. I put my head up high, the same day went and got some cheap earrings and put them on. I used to struggle to get out of my room but now I was eager. People liked my new look and said I looked great. Soon, I got my confidence back, it felt as if I had more confidence now, i was smiling and was radiant all the time. I think it was some time last year during covid that I realized I had saved enough money to afford a hair transplant,but I decided I would stick to being bald. there were other reasons as well, but the main reason was that I had accepted myself and I did not want to change that. This had become a part of my identity. I had battled a lot and this was a scar I get to sport just like a soldier after a battle. My bald head has brought so much pain but also so much understanding. 

Ahile samma I am still single hai tara, it may be because of my hair or just because I am such an introvert. To all the girls out there, it is such a taboo to be bald but it is just a matter if time because a lot of males suffer from baldness. It does not mean anything. And all the other useless people out there stop body shaming people. I’ve realized being bald is no problem abroad but it is such a big deal in Nepal. I am still recovering from all that bullshit.

To all the sparkling headed kings out there, keep strong 💪 , be smart, and be confident.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/sgb2ll/baldness_selfrespect_and_confidence/,1/30/2022 15:05,100,0,55,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,1,1,1
1g42mgw,Annapurna solo trek and general Nepal,"Hello guys,

I am new to Reddit and so I am not sure how it works. Hopefully I did not create a post somewhere, where it is not suppose to be.

I recently lost my job and now I would like to spend few weeks / months traveling to relax after a very stressful period. Nepal was on my list for very long time and I feel that time is right to visit it.

My main goal would be to do Annapurna Circuit Trek but also visit other places (at least Kathmandu and Pokhara) that you might recommend.

There are however few questions I would like to ask and hopefully you will be able to help me.

I come from Slovakia, so budget is something I need to keep in mind (we are lower income country in Europe) but I also want to support local communities, so I dont need to always go for the cheapest option, as I believe that people deserve good pay for their products and services.

As for my experience, I would consider myself semi-experienced hiker. Slovakia has lot of mountains, so I spent some time there (all are under 3000 meters), I also did some via ferratas in Italian Dolomites, hiked to the top of Marmolada and last year also hiked to top of Ararat mountain. I am 31 years old with very good stamina and so physically I am not concerned that I would not manage (if I avoid injury that is).

As for my questions:
1. I read on the internet that it is mandatory nowadays to have a hiking guide even if you go solo. Is this true? I would consider it anyway, because I never been to Himalayas and I dont want to underestimate the environment. Do you have any recommendations where I can get one? I am okay with doing small group trek as well - no more than 5 people, as I am a bit introverted.
2. Somebody on the internet mentioned that is it better NOT to book guides online and just walk into tourist office in Kathmandu / Pokhara and find guides there, as it might be considerably cheaper. Is this true?
3. My plan is to do this trek in second half of November - basically last 2 weeks of November, give or take - would this be good time period?
4. I have majority of my trekking gear already but I heard that you can buy missing stuff in Kathmandu, Thamel district - is this is valid option?
5. I prefer guide also because I am bit worried about tea house / sleeping availability. Is it big concern or is it more or less - you come and can sleep at almost any place?
5. What other places would you recommend seeing in Nepal?
6. What small gifts from Europe would Nepalese people like? I always bring something for the local people as a gift for their help.
7. Any other recommendation?

1fnfwoy,Pending homework led to panic situation in my life,"Back in school, We had this weird schedule where two subjects would alternate every 3 days. Where teacher A come for 3 days and teacher B come for other 3days.

One day Teacher B calls in sick and our Classes get cancelled. We were happy and relaxing for that day.

But wait, plot twist! happened when Teacher A, whose classes weren't affected, strolls in like nothing happened from second day. And what does he do? Asks for homework assigned earlier that week. Homework that was nestled safely in my ""I'll do it later"" pile because, you know, I thought I had all this extra time.

When he ask for the homework i was trying to telepathically communicate with my backpack and praying to magically produce completed homework. I still remember this stressful time in my life. Later he let us stood outside the class and made us do while sitting on the ground it his homework.

1dp4hvy,Terrible Experience with Roommate.,"So, I(18M) am currently living in Kathmandu. I came 2 years ago for my +2 .I lived alone for 1 year and then for next year my parents sent a relative brother(20M) whom I didn't even know it became hard to live with him in a single small room and as an introvert I prefer being alone but he hindered my private space and his habits like using mobile in loud sound and lazyness make me stressed and build a sense of prejudice towards him.
The problem is  that I can't adapt with him due to his habits and nature. There is not good bonding of me with him.
The main problem is also his financial condition where my dad promised his father to look after the expenses of room and else and since then mostly I spend all the money for the supplies and other stuffs, he look after his personal expenses and sometimes contributes in basic expenses too if he got money. My parents just to sent him for my good and support but he mostly disturbed me and became a liability for me. Some of his good habits and my sympathy towards him is only the reason that we are still together.

After a year with a whole lot of overthinking I thought of living taking bigger rooms too but that also won't work for me due to my nature so I finally decide to go with partition and overthinking about it already stressed me. He also nowdays changed his some of bad habits but still. It is a lot to make him like that with countless saying and request.

I am at my hometown nowdays after +2 exams and confessed about this in message today I confessed him my problem and asked we should live differently, he also accepted and say he will do and ask his parents.We also talked about that some time ago and he said he will do it somehow by doing job and else which is  good for him.

I learned that sometimes you also should show pity on yourself than others from this. Sometimes being a little selfish is good as we are humans who don't know what's perfectly good for us and should guide towards what things will work and overthinking only kills you. Take steps to make your life better.

1eq3fw8,Need suggestions/ help regarding family issue or idk what to call it,"So it's been quite a while since my cousin brother(x) came to live with my family because he has some issues with our other Didi who he used to live with 4-5 years prior. Was living with his fufu since his mom and dad were in HK. 

Recently from a year he has been showing signs of anger which doesn't just stop at shouting but raging and throwing hands. It used to be just doing that Gus Gus garera (mukh xadne) in small when smtg doesn't go his way but he did that to my mom as well who couldn't do smtg to change or stop him since his already old enough. Which I didn't like as she gets called words some other kid that just came to our family to stay with. 

I didn't like the changes he was making as well as his behaviour towards my parents. I only let it through cause it was only a year till he finishes his study and goes hk with his mom. He has his own issues but he could learn and do better while staying with my family.

Some issues that he caused were verbal arguments with my mom when she didn't do anything wrong. Then we got our selves a cat that even he liked and raised together however when things didn't go his way with the cat (pee in his room, scratch, go outside of his room) he used to abuse our cat. Idk about the rule here so I won't say it directly but once our cat got sick and started vomiting which would cause him to abuse her( cat) more and despite my effort stopping him that time she ( cat ) didn't make it. I would already inform the officials or make some report if not for my mom and his mom saying it's just some time we need to bear his oppression which my mom did follow along with as she does care for every child which can be dumb in times like this and doesn't want ruin his future and social.

Similarly after that incident I heard he cried and said why didn't we stop him after he did that. And I did stop him as well it's my bad as well being not as strong but when people are angry he doesn't see shi. And he probably wanted to redeem himself so he brought 3 -4 kittens ordered it online or smtg however after he brought them my dad my so against it as he didn't like them much more to the fact it used to bother him due to him having to rely on the right part of his body to walk around and the cats might bother him while he stretches around walking. And that became the start of another thing which started verbally then started to go physically while he tried swinging fists or throw glasses   or hit him with a stick to my (I don't like calling him this but) disabled dad ( he got brains truck and has his left side paralyzed/not wise with words as he already has much on his mind) he didn't actually get to hit him my mom and I did stop him however my mom's hand got hurt in the progress.

We called najik KO relatives so he can calm down and sort out the situation but never did go through something like police cause of what my mom as well as most relatives want no involvement of police cause they think it will harm their reputation as well as X's rep which I don't think should matter when things are turning bad. However things just passed on relatives and mom believed his action were due to some Graha and k k and my mom took him to places that his mom recommended it quilted down a bit but still not over with the verbal stuff he used to say to my mom.

I was letting it happen like a dumb son that can't do ntg we already have much trouble on our own so I didn't want to make it something big as well but considering my family I had a hard time staying with x. 

Now comes the part for me to post this with the issue that happened last night, I do my work in my laptop in the living hall close to the main door which we lock cause of mosquitoes he came and he knocked while I was on work but I still opened the door damn quick but slammed the door hard right when I was opening and cursed at me while I just responded kholdai xu ta brother k vako not even in a rude way . Then he began cussing and going to his room while I just shakes it off and began work again.

After 20-30 mins after me and my mom went to get some groceries and get back to working and he comes around and starts cussing me hard saying he doesn't like what I said k k k k k ani it eventually got to ma talai marxu which is quite a statement he made and I pulled up 100 for it. While he kepting cussing and whatever I just said what did I even do. Xitai khholeko xu dokha ni k k vhandai ni nahune respectfully shouldn't have done that but it's better keeping the damages minimal. Then out of nowhere he came and threw a frying pan at me which I didn't even notice till it bounced off the left side of my wall and fell to the place I was sitting. 

I would have definitely bleed with the amount of sheer force he used to throw that, well but it definitely didn't hit. Is that something for attempted murder? Since he kept cussing while saying I will kill you stuff. He was legit trying to beat me and my mom stopped him. I even lowered my voice for him and told sorry at that moment while my mom was holding him off as I thought he might just push my mom in anger and I was already far behind. Then me and my mom just got outside and called someone we knew and I called his mom to inform about the incident. I however wanted to go to official report and I still do.( Writing this post cause I can't sleep from the previous tantrums I even see him beating my parents in my dream ) Kill doesn't feel like some short statement like hanxu talai and marxu. As everything kind of settled his mom said to bear 1/2 more months of living with him.

And this X brat had the audacity to complain to his mother about my mother not giving food to him on time as she mentioned that to my mom while we informed about the issue which idk how trying to kill me even comes close to my mother not cooking for him on time as x himself doesn't eat cause of the time schedule.( X had made and threat to his fufu he used to live with during these certain phase as well and fufu used to consult if she needs to ask police for help and was quite scared for herself and didn't go out of her room it has it's own long story but not for now)

And here I am scared as well as angry for the fact me and my family has to let this continue.

 Should I proceed with the officials or what do I have to do. Considering other bad situations happening going to officials might give us a harder time and my mom thinks if I do report and he leaves he might hit or do smtg when he sees me somewhere. I need some suggestions. 
It's my first time writing something like this I hope it's readable. Suggestions for what to do( am most likely asking him to get a single room till his study finished in 1/2 months now and am not satisfied with it tbh considering how much of mental stress he has given and with the attempt to hit or kill me as I don't feel safe at all I consider him a psychopath)!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1eq3fw8/need_suggestions_help_regarding_family_issue_or/,8/12/2024 3:20,2,0,6,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,1,2
w9ystc,Finally became a father after 23 hours of ordeal,"*Before starting the account, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the team of Gyneco/Obs department of TU Teaching Hospital led by Dr. KDB, including young and active doctors and nurses, as well as other hospital personnel for their correct diagnosis, treatment, supervision, explanation, relentless support and follow-up, who helped my wife to endure the trial and deliver a healthy baby.* 

So finally became a father last Thursday. 21st of June is considered to be the longest day of the year and on that day I personally felt this to be true. Our gynecologist at TUTH had asked us to come the day before to get admitted and by the time my wife got admitted it was almost 5 PM. She underwent a series of tests before being given the medicine for labor induction as she was past 40 weeks without natural pain. We were told that a cabin with double bed was available so I said Ok thinking that I would accompany my wife during the labor until her childbirth. Her bed was not in the maternity ward but in the female surgical ward and we were to share the cabin with an old lady who was supposed to have a surgery the next day. 

She started to experience the first discomfort after 7 PM. Until the next few hours she coped up with the pain using the two breathing exercises that I had taught based on Lamaze technique. However after around 12 PM it started being unbearable. I tried to comfort her by massaging her back and supporting her while she was standing, moving or squatting but it got more and more intense. Despite my moral support and positive motivation she became completely hopeless and told me that she couldn't do it anymore and implored me to do something"". I was hopeless. My wife had finally decided to give birth at the Teaching Hospital after being convinced somehow that it would be a better option, while for previous 8 months she was not ready for the normal delivery and said that she would undergo C-section at a private hospital. During the past week whenever she talked about her fear of the labor pain I comforted her saying that it wouldn't be as bad as she thought, that she was a strong woman who grew up in the mountains and that she would be able to do it easily. But how wrong I was. 

I then tried to convince her that she only had to bear the pain for 50 seconds and then the pain wouldn't come for the next 2 and half minutes. For this I even employed the stopwatch app, to make her believe that the intense pain came in waves and in an hour there were only 15 to 20 instances of such agony. I repeated that she was a strong woman and that she could handle those 20 instances easily. But after some time the pain came more frequently and she became more desparate and started to cry but in a low tone , trying as much as possible not to disturb the old woman who was to be operated the next day. She implored me to take her out of the hospital, anywhere. I knew this wasn't possible and even if it were, I wouldn't take my wife to a private hospital at the last moment to get operated. My last option was ask for an epidural. I called a nurse on duty at the desk close to our cabin to call a doctor. 1 hour passed very slowly but no doctor arrived. My wife was clutching my hand, in tears, asking me to do something. I went out again and asked the nurse whether the doctor was coming and she told me that he/she had an emergency so would arrive a bit late. I consoled my wife by saying that the doctor would arrive soon and that I would ask him/her for an epidural, explaining to her whatever I knew about the epidural. 

5 minutes would seem like an hour. Yes, 21st June, the longest day of the year. When the pain arrived my wife could no more continue the rhythmic breathing but started clutching her fists and even pulling her hair. Tears started to appear in my eyes but I turned to the other side to make sure she didn't see them rolling down. I went out again lying to her that I was going down to call the doctor. After about half an hour a doctor came in and asked me and the son of the old woman to go out of the cabin so that she could perform few tests on my wife. After she came out, I inquired her and she said the labor was starting but not as expected. I asked her if they could administer epidural to my wife to which she curtly replied that we had to decide about it beforehand and that it's better to ask with the doctor who would do rounds in the morning. I tried my best to pacify my wife by telling her that as soon as the doctor would come in the morning I would ask her for the pain relief. Now added to the weeping and sporadic hair pulling were grinding of teeth and other terrifying composures, all linked with extreme agony. At this point I wished I could share her pain or do anything to soothe her. But I was helpless. 

Slowly and painfully, the time stretched to 8 PM and in came the team of doctors who performed another couple of tests on my wife before taking her to the labor room. At this point I realized that the delivery was not happening in the cabin that we had booked. By this time her aunt had also arrived and I thought that maybe they would allow her inside to stay beside my wife until the childbirth. I was wrong again. No one was allowed inside the labor room, not even a female friend or a family member. This made me even more hopeless but her aunt consoled me saying that everything would be alright and seeing women around her in similar state would make her feel more comfortable. 
Next few hours passed in a complete chaos as I would not know what was going on inside. They would call us intermittently to bring some medicine, soup or approval slip for some tests but would never let us in. While inquiring about my wife they would give the same answer - ""the labor pain is progressing well but the dilation is not enough"". I began to get stressed, very very stressed; in only few instances had I been so much stressed in my life. I finally decided to have a talk with a doctor there and ask if epidural was possible. A young doctor tersely replied that she would call her senior and out came another young-ish doctor who tried to explain me, in a philosophical undertone, the importance of pain. My wife was out in the lobby of the labor room at the moment and was asking the doctor, in sobs, to ""give her an injection"" [epidural] because she could tolerate the pain nomore and if that continued she would not be alive anymore. But the doctor comforted her and escorted her inside before telling me not to worry.

I went out and told one of my in-laws that if it continued for an hour I would get her out of the hospital to a private one and arrange for a C-section. But the in-law explained that it was normal for me to be anxious to that point, but everything would be alright as all women experience the same pain and have to go through the similar ordeal in order to have a baby. Although I didn’t agree to all she said I felt maybe I should just trust the doctors and nurses that they would take the best care of my wife and our baby-to-arrive-soon. Having not slept for almost 36 hours straight, plus stressed and anxious, I decided to go home and have some sleep before bringing some soup. I went home thinking that getting some sleep would help me deal with the stress, but not even 20 minutes had passed that I was woken up by my dad who told me to come to the hospital immediately because they had asked him to fetch some clothes of the baby and the mother as the previously supplied clothes were wet. Excited and thanking gods, I rushed to the hospital only to find my dad waiting outside the labor room but not yet certain that his grandchild was born. I suspected that maybe the water-break had just occurred which wet the clothes we had supplied in the morning, and that’s why they were asking for new clothes. So, I thought my dad was mistaken to assume their asking him to bring new set of clothes as our baby being born. Besides, he also told that they did not reveal whether it was a boy or a girl. Strange. When we asked inside we were not given straight answer but were offhandedly told to bring another bowl of soup. When I returned back with the soup my wife was at the main entrance of the labor room, on a wheelchair with a new-born baby in her hand. I was filled with a mix of emotions: stress, worry, tiredness (no sleep + having to walk a kilometer to fetch a soup as TUTH canteen is closed), excitement and joy. While I always imagined that at the first sight of my baby I would only think of him/her and forget everything else, it wasn’t true because the other emotions took a toll on me. Only a few hours later would I feel the joy exclusively. My wife, the mother, too was filled with traumatic effect of the pain she had not anticipated and this shadowed her joy to some extent. But in a few hours we were happy parents of a new born baby boy whose name is yet to be decided. 

I would again like to thank the entire team of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff of TU Teaching Hospital involved directly and indirectly. However, I think that allowing at least one person, a female member, to accompany the birthing mom in the labor room and asking whether or not the mother would like to have epidural administered would make the inexplicably experience of the mother more sufferable.

19dkad0,What do my dreams mean? Do share your insights.,"I have very vivid dreams every single night. There are three dreams that are recurring and set in in slightly different scenarios each time. Since they're so realistic where the story, background and characters are so well developed and detailed, when something sad happens, I am affected even after waking up. The last time I remember I cried and was left devastated for days. Except for these three recurring ones, my dreams are usually very fun, creative and crafted like epic fantasy novels.

Additionally, about 60 percent of the time, they are lucid(i am aware that I'm dreaming) making it even more exciting because I can control them. The downside to it being that it's hard to know if I'm not dreaming even when I'm awake.

My theory is that my brain is just trying to make up for the extremely monotonous life that I live;I have no friends and the only people that I interact with are my family members. I would like to know if any of you guys have experienced or experience the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/19dkad0/what_do_my_dreams_mean_do_share_your_insights/,1/23/2024 9:05,7,0,18,English,0,0,1,0,0,0

1cq8w08,Need some words of motivation,"So my mom and dad used to run a poultry and grocery shop. We weren't rich but we were doing just fine. Then my father decided to put up our land for loan to invest more in our business but he used to gamble and drink so he prolly wasted  more money there. Then mom got introduced to crpto, took out more loan to invest but that went down too. Then everything started crumbling,  we couldn't pay back the interests, didn't have any money to stock up the shop so we closed it. And now my parents are farming (it has only been a few months). We don't have any asset and don't have any income source either. We owe so much to so many people even the bank too.  We could barely pay my college fees and idk how I'm going to study further.

15cvkex,My Journey applying to US universities,"I am sure many of you have read the previous Reddit post, so this is a follow-up since many of you were curious. I graduated with A-levels in August 2022 with really good grades. I also have some good extracurriculars with noteworthy recommendations from my teachers. So, I would say I had a fairly good application holistically. I also write pretty well so my essays were fine too. I put a lot of effort to write my common app essay, so I am really proud of that.

I started applying to US universities in the fall of 2022 when I was still studying in grade 12, so I would have some knowledge about the process. I could have gone to the USA after graduation in August 2022 if I had wanted to. But, I thought I could get better opportunities with even better preparation for fall 2023. With a whole gap year ahead, I wanted to focus on research papers and working part-time and that is exactly what I did. I also searched potential universities categorizing them into reach dream, target, and safety universities. 

It was going well. I was writing my Commonapp essay and also got my SAT done. I scored 1450 on it. I had already given IELTS on Nov 2021 with a score of 8. All that was left was to apply. But then I got impatient. I couldn't fathom spending another 8 months in Nepal while doing nothing. So, I rushed for spring. However, if you are applying in spring, you do not have a whole lot of options. I ended up opting for Norwich which actually took a lot of convincing since the university is quite small and in a really remote location within the USA. I thought I would transfer once I get there. Little did I know I would be rejected keke. Norwich is a mid-tier university that offers most international students the same scholarships. I think the reason behind my reaction was that I picked a university that anyone could get into when I could get into better a much better one. I can say that quite confidently because all was going well in the interview until he checked my transcripts and compared it with my I-20. So, one piece of advice I would give to good students is DO NOT SETTLE for less because visa officers want good students to go to good universities. 

I got rejected in Dec and most of you probably know that most US universities close their application for fall at the end on Jan 15 or Jan 1. So, I hurried to apply to other universities I wanted to for spring but could not because they only have Fall available. I was done with most of my applications by the end of December but I got lazy because I already had acceptance from Howard University and good merit aid. They even talked about financial aid that would be given around the end of January. So, I settled on Howard because a couple of my seniors go there. Over the course of January, I waited for financial aid and other college decisions. 

GUESS WHAT? Howard suddenly out of thin air decided to take back international aid. I was fixated on Howard and relaxed with college essays since I thought I would go there. I had a second meltdown there. I truly felt helpless at that time. But, college decisions were rolling in so I was hopeful. I also had IOWA state uni as safety with COa of 25k just in case. Hence, I held out my hope. Amidst the chaos in my life and head, I was accepted to SUNY Buffalo with a 15k flagship scholarship. I couldn't afford the university with just that but I saw they had an honors scholarship worth $9500. The catch is that only one international student receives it for each incoming class. The thing with me is that I will try to grab any opportunity thrown my way. So, there I was writing 5 more essays to submit for the honors scholarship. I tried keeping my hopes low so as not to disappoint myself. I knew deep down that if I received that scholarship, I would go to SUNY Buffalo without blinking an eye. 

After a month of waiting, I got an email saying I was selected for the interview. A step closer to the scholarship. However, It felt wrong to expect too much. Since what are the chances that out of all international students getting into the university, I would be the one to get it. With low expectations, I gave my honors interview, and safe to say, the people who interviewed me seemed really happy and we talked for almost an hour. I felt relieved but also the decision kept me at bay for a few weeks. After a long dreadful week, I finally received an email saying I was going to the international student getting that award. I was over the bay. A few days later, I received another scholarship worth $3000 a year for women's empowerment. AHH, Finally things were lining up for me. 

I immediately paid the university deposit to get my i-20 and then paid MRV fees in Nepal and waited and waited and waited for visa application dates to no end. Days turned into weeks and then into months. I transferred my account to India and paid fees there and waited. The wait for visa dates was probably the most gruesome part of everything I have gone through until today. Both Nepal and India had no dates so, I started thinking of Singapore and Thailand. I was skeptical about going to Thailand for an interview since nobody knew the visa situation there and if it was even worth going. I got dates for Thailand and went there hoping this would end it for once and all. This was my make-it-or-break-it. On the day of the interview, I knew my life would change for good or for worse. I braced myself and gave my interview. I was pretty positive about it since I was going somewhere that I wanted. SUNY Buffalo is a great university with really good opportunities and a great international community. I was also in Honors College and leadership house which are both UB's exclusive programs. So, this was a MASSIVE update for me compared to Norwich. I was able to portray these changes and as you all you, I got my visa. 

I am really happy with myself. Studying in the USA has always been a dream of mine that is finally coming true. It wasn't an overnight decision that I took. I studied hard in 10 for sendup to get into one of the top schools for Nepal for A levels since it starts earlier than +2. I took A-levels for the purpose of applying abroad. I was also able to transfer my credit from A-levels so I am almost a semester ahead too. Everything until now was carefully planned and crafted aside from the rejection and multiple heartbreaks and rejections from college in between. These past 8 months have tested my patience, resilience and just been extremely difficult. But I have made it. I am sure this answers a lot of your questions and will help upcoming students who plan on studying abroad. I am really thankful for my teachers especially my college counselor and teachers who wrote my recommendations, my friends who helped improve my college essay and reviewed every essay I wrote for my application, and my mom who stood quietly behind me praying for my success. Also, I cannot thank my boyfriend enough who always made sure I was okay when I was stressing about applications, scholarships, and visa process. The difficulty of this whole process has really made me appreciate the end result. I can finally sleep in peace without worry. 

There are 4 more years of university ahead. I am double majoring in Mechanical and aerospace engineering so, it will be tough. Nothing until now has been easy. I laugh looking back at myself worrying about scholarships and visas. Someday, I will look back again when I graduate and laugh at myself for stressing about my grades. 

Best of Luck to everyone who shares the same dream as me. I hope all goes well for you too. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/15cvkex/my_journey_applying_to_us_universities/,7/29/2023 15:50,29,0,25,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

2. From women perspective: male are capturing everything so they are responsible 

3. From racial perspective: Khas-Arya are responsible because for the obvious reason!

4. From regional perspective: tarai and himal people can and must say the pahadi people are responsible, which makes sense!

12dapfh,Am i late ? I am 20 years old rn.,"So i finished my highschool back in 2021 and till this day i havent yet started my Bachelors. Its not like i am comparing self with my mates rather i am worried about my future. I was always a above average kid since school (like  80 above)  and did well too in my studies. Then later my 12 i started learning German language and stopped venturing out other options. As for someone from a middle class its always a desire not to be a burden for your parents and be Independent. Thats why i decided to pursue my further education in Germany because of the free education knowingly that its gonna cost my everything time, money, dedication and most importantly my time. I did the language for a entire year and cleared all the level and finally did gave my visa interview recently. The Interview didnt went well as i thought it would be and i dont even know if i am gonna get it . 

Looking way back to my formel self  i wish i had made different choices. Even me going for US would be much more options considering the time frame of doing IELTS and SAT and to that of learning a new language with no more others options. I feel so stressed right now and its making me fall more into hopelessness. 
At this point i feel sorry for my parents because they went through alot just for the sake of me. 

I still have a little hope for getting a visa but i would also like to be prepared for the wrost case scenario. This was my last shot and thats the end of the chapter. 

I actually wanted to study Aerospace engineering but if it doesnt goes according to my plan than i  would be okay even going for Software engineering or somewhat that actually is versatile. I just wanna know if i  can still get into KU regardless of my gap year. To all those here studying in KU , is it good ? Which programmes would be worth getting into ?  And  considering i didnt studied for almost 2 years will i able to  pass the entrance exam if i started preparing now and how long would i need ? Is self preparing enough cause  i dont have much more courage left to ask my parents to pay for some extra classes. Any Suggestion would be very much appreciated.

o9cunm,Rental Issue,"We rented out our house to a couple who started a Hostel in our house. This was on 2019. This was 3-4 months before the pandemic hit. We agreed in a contract for 3 months advance rent. During the lockdown we gave 2 months rent free and the next 3 months 25% off and next 3 40% off and also charged rent on a monthly basis. Then it started to be normal so we charged the normal rent but still on monthly basis. Every time the rent was delayed 1-2 weeks. We had to call n call everyday to remind them and they used to say "" ok ok voli rakhdinchu"". 

We were getting sick n tired. My mom is a single mom with heart issues and arthritis. She used to look after all the things related to rental. I am busy with my work n study. So couldn't go there and talk to them. They used to make excuses to meet us since the house is managed by some care taker.

Recently tired of the excuses my mom phoned to the guy to empty the house with one month notice, which was in the contract. He threatened to burn our house and take us to court. Frightened my mom and overcome with stress she felt ill. 

Finally she told me about the things and i called the guy. Obviously he lied and told us we have to compensate him on the basis of money he has spend on our house i.e. partition and beds and whatever. He told us he wont empty it and will take us to court. We have a signed contract for 5 years and it has benn 2 years now.

My mom us really stressed and getting worse by the day. I have talked to him but he says our house is 'alachina' and he hasnt earned any profit at all. Yet he won't leave the house. 

I dont know abt any house/rental laws. Its really taking a toll on us. We feel threatened because we cant go there everyday to check on the house ( we live on the outskirts on KTM and the house is in ringroad)

What should I do? He wont pay rent on time always making excuses. He wont pay rent in advance. He hasnt cleared house tax which was in the contract. He hadn't paid the electricity bill for 3-4 months. When asked he said 'tapai ko tauko dukhai ko kura nai goina' but he did eventually. We have given him sooo much leeway during the first phase of pandemic. But now he's taking advantage of that. 

Any legal or ethical suggestions needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/o9cunm/rental_issue/,6/28/2021 4:24,59,0,41,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,1,2

An engineering students with alot of back papers with no solid plans and ambitions.Not only this the family owns a business which is in losses but couldnot sold as we are over dependent on it,not finding  buyers.I am tensed and stressed out by the fact that I have no earning and earning from job might not be able to improvise the situation (rent,interest,expenses).The house owner gives threat of bringing new renters.When asking for loans no one is ready.

18gdbyx,How to deal with burnouts from work?,"It's been almost 4 months that I've been experiencing this. At first it was thrilling. I'd be working for 11 or 12 hours a day and even on Saturdays.. At first it was alright. Gave me some sort of feeling of accomplishments but of course it didn't last long. It started extending even more and more after that. I basically lost my personal life after that and everything is revolving around my job after that. I also get this urge to leave the job but it's paying me really well and If I leave it's going to put me in a financially complicated state. I know I could just get another job but the only concerning thing about that is payment. There is a chance that I might get paid a lot less than what my current company pays. 

I asked for less work. And I was granted that. But now I feel anxious. I wake up at 5 usually. And I start feeling anxious about work. Work ma huda I'm anxious and even after work I'm anxious. So much so that even when I'm dreaming I dream about working and even in dream I'm anxious. I took a week off a few weeks ago. But that didn't help either. Even when I was on leave, I was anxious about work. 

The only moment I'm happy is when I get salary. Which lasts for about 2 minutes. And I'm anxious about how I'll go on for one more month. Everything is stressing me out. When I first joined this job, I loved it. I loved doing my job. It was kind of my dream job. Everything was so great. My job used to be an escape.

y6tmc6,A Modern Nepal that foreigners and travellers know,"One of my favourite topics to talk about is people and culture. To people (mostly foreigners and travellers) I meet, either long-term networking or just one introduction I love answering their queries about Nepal.

I have talked about Nepal to over 1000 people in my travels in Europe and Asia in the last ten years (most specifically the last four years.)

A few (around 5%) were  completely unaware of Nepal, but most of those people who have heard or visited relate to me with two things:
1. It is a country of mountains. 
2. People are lovely, kind and hardworking. 

Especially those who have previously visited/travelled to Nepal stress the statement, ""Nepali are very kind and I would like to visit Nepal again"". 

Their response makes me joyful. I feel ecstatic. 

Our history might have introduced us as Gorkhali:- unbeatable, cruel and loyal fighters, but today we are also known for love and kindness. 

We are nowhere to be perfect. Our infrastructure and cost of living has risen up, it's more expensive than most of the South Asian countries, but if anything has helped Nepal tourism stay alive, they are indeed our mountains and the kindness we share among people. 

As a Nepali, there is no bigger happiness. 

Let's continue to be kind to every person we meet. Visitors and travellers have spread your kind gesture to people around them, more than  you have ever expected

1c5ci6r,Seeking Volunteers for Research on Parentification,"Hi everyone,

I'm conducting a study on Parentification in the context of Nepal, a phenomenon many children, especially in Asian families or collectivist societies, experience. Often, you might have been told as a child that you were ""so mature for your age."" This usually meant having to grow up too quickly, taking on adult-like responsibilities due to various family circumstances—maybe there was an alcoholic parent, a chronically ill family member, financial struggles, or both parents were working, leaving you to care for younger siblings or handle household chores. 

These experiences might have forced some of us to start working early to support our families, skipping the chance to explore different life paths. While growing up this can make us strong, independent, and resilient but it can also leave us with feelings of resentment, stress, and overwhelming emotions from handling such responsibilities too soon. 

My research aims to explore how Parentification has impacted our general well-being and various aspects of life. If you resonate with these experiences and are willing to share your story, I'd greatly appreciate your participation. 

Please click on the link below to fill out a questionnaire. https://derby.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7WcsZzdjdjK2PGK 

Your input is incredibly valuable, and by sharing your experiences, you can help shed light on the effects of Parentification.

rapsdn,The truth about legalize Nepal movement,"Kids, sit around this is a good one.

Since we have a petition in this sub for legalization of Cannabis, here is my apprehension regarding it. I's a bulletin list. Disclaimer, I want Cannabis to be legalized, not the way LegaliseNepal movement wants.

1. Campaign Finances: Who is paying for this movement? Why are they paying for it? If their argument is ""we are volunteers"" I have absolutely zero faith in them achieving anything other than social media hype and clout because this requires money to push in Nepal. If the other case is that, they have a funding source, it should be transparent. If it's not transparent, you lost my vote. Also, those individuals thinking ""Nepal ma yesto videshi transparent tarika chaldaina"" argument won't work here in this case, because Legalizing Cannabis is also held down by same argument. You can't use same logic for and against in the same issue.
2. Lack of vision: I have heard conversations from the top leaders on Clubhouse. One of them yelled at me for suggesting we should have a research data driven base to see ramifications of legalization. Making it into a formal industry. Why do you think farmers are suffering? If you have a data driven approach in farming, you can succeed. These individuals have no plans for data driven approach. Touting facts about CBD does jack shit, if you have no plan.
3. Actual happenings in the background: Politicians have bought land rights, set up companies and they are already enroute to manufacture large quantities. Because they have greed and I trust a politicians greed in Nepal more than an idealistic youth. Youth fades away, greed stays. So, it's going to be legalized regardless. If you want to legalize it, talk to your representative. Cut out the middlemen. When they come for your vote, tell them to their face.
4. Usage: The usage of cannabis is weird in Nepal. People who will abuse it will be above 35. The data for the age group coincides with individuals with high stresses and those being above 35. Teens and kids won't be able to do it, because they won't be able to afford it since tax is gonna be high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/rapsdn/the_truth_about_legalize_nepal_movement/,12/7/2021 3:41,38,0,31,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,1,0,0,0,0

102p7hl,Nepal way of making money and core advantage being hydropower and tourism is bs*. They will never be rich or developed.,"They will never be rich or developed by that. However, can profit from that and earn well **after being developed, rich** and **stable**.

[https://youtu.be/h-VP2\_ELY9k](https://youtu.be/h-VP2_ELY9k)= With this type of mindset, no job, wealth, development.

How do other country like Nepal, with no dependency on tourism and no hydropower export. How do they become developed and rich.

Without mountains tourism which is our cash cow, the rest of what people want is mediocre vs competition in tourism. We are a small player there, and we can't change that by a big margin. This can be proven where we the people of Nepal have gone to? All mainstream places are mediocre places compared to competition, our best places that aren't  mountain's or hiking aren't even developed, mainstream and hard to reach. Places we can give a battle to our competition, specially with our genuine people living as 1 with the nature.

I**f an undeveloped country is even 50 percent developed on tourism, that is a bad thing,** as undeveloped countries being dependent on tourism mean they will never develop and get stuck in development and optimization in different sector's. And where even domestic production for local's will get conquered by foreign player's and big cooperation. I rather be stuck with 10 percent dependency on tourism with only rise in mountain tourism and less GDP, than more dependency on tourism while being massively undeveloped and poor. Kinda like a Dutch disease.

You don't need to build an airport for tourism, next to the border, as Indians would only be 1 to use flight's to BIA, as people from Sri Lanka East Asia, won't mind to pay 50 dollar for a local flight from TIA. Instead, bring cost down to 50 dollar or lower to local airport near Lumbini, and even subsidize it, if there is big amount of tourist and big quantity.

The thing we need for more tourism is stability and safety, which comes with development. And mainstream marketing to show that Nepal exists. The mountains do the marketing for them self, we just have to increase it cause, there is the money, and that niche for mountains and hiking without comfort is a small niche audience. With a lot of competition of places all around the world for that small percent of audience.

Maybe like some in the Middle East, Dubai or Europe. The tourism of not mountain tourism could rise after being developed 1st. And not be dependent to thinking getting rich or developed by tourism. For us, we don't need high investment like them, we need high quality road's in the high hill parts of Nepal, from far west to everywhere north.

As of hydropower, there even if GDP will even be 20% more in paper in a fictional world, government, cooperation's and few will become rich, with not much job creation and wealth change for the common man. But that would never happen, even not 20% in few years combined. It, it is a ton of investment in the garbage, if our electricity isn't relative cheaper than what we can buy for. To sell it is a big investment lost that could go somewhere else. **So we can only better use hydropower as a weapon for stability for our own consumption and specially for undeveloped villages paired with technology to have water all over Nepali villages middle of nowhere and for agriculture.**

As Nepal in term's of tourism is nowhere, it can create an own niche, a thriving raw village full of people and agriculture in a surreal view and raw place with limited crops like the west or very up where some Gurung's live, but not way up where it is more dry, cold and discomforting. Have a modern but authentic wooden/mud housing for people hiking there and house with bathtub or jacuzzi and between hotel's shared wooden design swimming pool with warm water. Ban on concrete or modern houses. And the most important step, an under 50 dollar domestic flight to the biggest airport of Karnali Pradesh or other state, and broad highway to reach near to places like jumla, bajura, badimalika, or northern raw greatness like some gem of gurung gau's. Or some gems in northern part of the east, superior to illam. Also, after a broad highway or concrete way till where it is possible. Broad mud way of 3 car lane width for off-road car to reach the tourist's to destination. Cause mud way is no view of not development at all, it is a part of the experience, a great off-road experience, but it has to be very wide, and well orientated otherwise people will associate the experience with undeveloped dangerous, scary mess.

When people have choices for nature or cultural or hiking, between Scotland, Peru, Switzerland, Brazil, Italy, Greece, Thailand, Indonesia, New Zealand, India, USA, Chile, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada South Africa, Egypt, Jordan, Croatia, France, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijani and many more. And tourism is real business because it is a big investment. You have to reach from the city to those places fast and with comfort.

And we have good mountain tourism to offer, not tourism. Cause the best places, are not reachable unless you are a YouTubers, or a well researching retired American or European tourist who came to discover not comfort. And who knows more than the average Nepali about the place's. Then you limited your bucket by having no chance to have a piece of the average people going once a year far abroad to forget their work stress and splash money in a foreign economy. We have to know that every tourist has a busy life with busy carrier. But they want to discover with comfort.

The fact is there are less, more or same amount of picturesque and raw nature like in Nepal, they are just different but of same level. The different is there you can reach by road to your destination, and fast and comfortably. In Nepal, for the best picturesque and raw not mountain places worth competition, takes, 12 by car. 6 hours' by jeep,2-6 or 10+ hour's by foot. With no comfort in comparison to the destination where we lose people escaping stress and wanting to be fulfilled by discovering. And go every year abroad with their family.

**Nepal could be a better destination by raw genuine people living in raw beautiful landscape. That is what we can pitch to the depressed west.** It could be a better destination than the rest by being a more alive location by having who live there with harmony with the nature and being 1 with it.

Unlike our European and other counterpart, where we see nature it is beautiful, what next?

But to even bring something competitive we have to develop and have ton's of good road's and highway if we want to make money by it. Cause with location like ktm, pokhara, chitwan we don't have much to compete as those are not our gem, they only offer accessibility and comfort. Also, you have to build a lot of attraction's around, instead of airport's in more raw places we need several things if we want tourist and have them entertained for 1 week in the zone. Which also cost's ton's of money. So if we want to develop that to even have enough tourism. We 1st need to develop making money by other means, being happy of the money mountain travel earns from niche audience. Invest and focus elsewhere than tourism, develop the country, rise in safety and stability. And then invest, mainstream approach and **pull tourism** in the country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/102p7hl/nepal_way_of_making_money_and_core_advantage/,1/4/2023 0:54,5,0,22,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

Ik everyone has an opinion on whether the USA should be the world police that discussion is to be had, but what is happening in Afghanistan is repulsive and disgusting USA  has spent 6.5 trillion on the war in Afghanistan and have lost 2.5k soldiers during that time. Ik USA CANT stay in Afghanistan forever, but the way the withdrawal was handled was horrible set aside politics, what Joe Biden has done is pure fucking stupid. Why did so many Nepali fight in  Afghanistan to give the country back to the Taliban ?? What’s even more sad and tragic was the  Afghan citizen that stood shoulder to shoulder with the USA by helping them translate or helping any way they can so they can see a better day got a big middle finger. Now they will be slaughtered by the Taliban, and no one there to help them. I can’t stress this fact enough the fucking incompetence from the Biden administration is mind-boggling, and this set a horrible precedent. Lastly, the region will be destabilized, and it will have and impact on India and Nepal . Lastly, I will end it by saying this why did 2.5k soldiers die for this ?? Why did 500  Uk soldiers die for this ?? Why did 241k Afghan citizens die for this ???  Why did Nepali citizens die for this ???  The way the Afghan president abandoned his people is fuc*ing disgraceful and spineless

rmhxna,A tip to students applying to the U.S. for higher studies.,"I am unsure about whether what I am about to say applies to you if you choose to study in other countries however I can say for certain that this will apply to you if you wish to attend an american university.

Grades. Are. Not. Everything. 

They are a priority but as long as you meet a threshold, anything above that will be irrelevant. When universities in the United States look for a kid from Nepal, they want diversity. They want a student that stands out and is different. 
What I mean by this is take for example there are two profiles.

Profile A: a stereotypical asian student 4.0 gpa, plays the piano, has model UNs under his/her belt and other activities that are not unique but considered generally impressive

Profile B: an asian student who is different. Lets say he/she is in a music band, has a passion for something interesting and productive such as building models (and is looking to major in architecture) and has a gpa that is good but not perfect 3.6-3.8 lets say. And finally has a killer personal essay.

Id argue the second student is more likely to get in. What Im trying to say is try to stand out. This is something Ive realized now that I am here studying in the united states and something I wish I had realized when I was applying. If universities wanted a perfect stereotypical asian student, they would pick every indian student who can easily out do us with perfect grades. So unless you have perfect grades, your best shot at getting into a school with aid is to stand out. So stop stressing out about your grades and SAT as much as you are. Donot completely forget about them but anything that is decent should be good enough.

Finally, make sure you have a killer personal essay. Good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/rmhxna/a_tip_to_students_applying_to_the_us_for_higher/,12/22/2021 23:39,23,0,30,English,0,0,0,1,0,1
xftf4k,"We should change capital to Pokhara, I saw video about cycle lanes in Pokhara. Then saw the importance of balen+tractor!","I live in Kathmandu and i think in theory we should just leave Kathmandu as the capital.

We need 1 megacity in Nepal which is as big and inhabited as Ktm, but which is worthy, spacious clean, and a city for the normal people and a city that prioritize pedestrians.

And i will explain how important the fierce Balen tractor abhiyan is, because Kathmandu everywhere is just so narrow and bad build where everyone did what they wanted decades ago that we now are left with a mess. And to make Kathmandu great city for the society, there the priority should be ease and functionality and not packed, narrow and stressful. But not only Kathmandu Muncipality but the whole district of KTM just so badly planned and build.

The whole Kathmandu district without the municipality has less population density but also badly build and planned. While having less people and infrastructure and having even land where you can add houses or just leave for agriculture, the rest of district is  even worsley build and planed  cause there was less authority decades ago when the building it all happened. In terms of narrow streets, roads, misuse of land and etc. It's worse than the municipality they just have more resident area then shops, but it's a total nightmare. And you can't destroy it all and start from 0.

&#x200B;

**Look to be a great city in Nepal. And to shift economic potential from another city, what are the requirements?**

Kathmandu has fruits of it's past like lot of jobs and industries.

But no potential and efficiency and no space to be an economic hub and rise with something new or be a social great place to live in. Or be better to live in then what it was for decades ago, now it's worse to live in, everything same, just more packed dirty and out of hands.

When the best of best people from everywhere comes in KTM, the best output also comes from here.

**But when the canvass is blank and there is space then people from ground level will come up with things and entrepreneurship will also rise so much. All in all it's not about business its about change and just getting out of stagnation. For me ktm today is just like decades ago, all the big infrastructure and buildings are from King Mahendra time or previous, while a lot of country in south east Asia have locally come with lot of change and innovation. And even city's like Butwal and lot in west like dhangadi have been doing well and coming up with thing's, and just like where they were 10 years ago and now is noticable. And the part that isnt in KTM= That individual peopels that could contribute cause of space, boldness and blank canvass in a way of authority to do something big. And then come up with big things.**

We need a place with good space and good peoples. Nepal is sandwiched between 2 countries which is like 100x bigger then Nepal in most aspects, it's just a great economic potential but we have to change with time and come up with things and innovation and that has to happens in big cities. And ktm is not the right place for it, cuz nothing to really become richer has to be rocket science. It just needed to be dared and or orchestrated. And again it's not about innovation and entrepreneurship but also the society and the things around the society to make our life at ease and be more advanced then in the past. We are not the same as in the past, no we are worse off, when talking about ktm.

1 Point 1 It has to able to offer and create a ton of jobs. Ktm>Pokhara

2  It has to be flat. Pokhara and KTM

It has to have enough land KTM districts has 413.69 km2 and Pokhara has  464.2 km²

3 population?  458,000 vs  2,017,532  It's 1/4 vs 3/4.

&#x200B;

**What do I want to change. I want us to shift to make Pokhara economically more huge then planned. And take some potential from Kathmandu.**

Like i don't like Nepal being a tourism depended country. Our nature is our everything vs what the cities has to offer. I rather have Nepal be a goods exporting country. And be dependent on it so we only afford eco tourism which is expensive.

So our pristine nature, mountains and nature wonders don't get filled with trash or distorted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Back to the point.**

When dubai was like a flat desert, imazine how easy it was to make thousand of high building next to each other, because it's a inghtmare and very harsh what happens under the ground with all the pipes and cords and etc. Cause of that it was very easy for them, eficent and cheap. Compared to America having to build some 10-20 building in already full with infrastructure places. The thing it's always easy to work on a blank canvass.

But it's harder and more expensive to undo all the mistakes that you have made, and now not talking about what's under the ground, the mistake in Kathmandu is just 80 percent of building, plannings and space management all together.

With Balen we are just goanna work on the 1 percent of the iceberg. And it will be a narrow good city. Cause what do you except destroy all the buildings make a wider road and etc. and free spaces here and there and removing...

**So what are the changes?**

If Pokhara airport can handle the capacity, make it the airport which is the airport for tourists to land on.

Let Pokhara be the city foreigners see our country and let them make desire to see the nature more and travel to other places like east, west and mountains and other hilly parts of Nepal.

And Kathmandu is a day trip. And if they are fascinated by the hustle and bustle a week max.

There are a lot of countries in south America and etc, those countries capital is just like KTM, full with hustle and bustle and packed and cramped. But not the reason tourists come for and not the city they land if there are choices. We didn't need a big airport in Pokhara, now we have it, change the current situation. And for tourists in Nepal, Pokhara can be a 1 week trip or more unlike for Nepalis, tourists just want to forget there stress and enjoy good time in hotel and sightseeing, they will manage well.

Last years there came a lot of foreigners in ktm for the city adventure and cheap tourisms. Did we lost the ability to attract new and young tourist who wants to spend time with the nature. If so we will be more and more dependent on cheaper tourism and they together with the government will care less about the distortion and trashing of the nature.

**Changes for locals.**

Look even Pokhara isn't well build and planned vs how it could be. And there are places which are as bad as KTM, but Pokhara is just far ahead when compared to KTM overall.

When a place isn't well built and planned it becomes a lot more narrow, dense and takes much more land while looking very unspacious.

But Pokhara is far ahead of KTM, so with cleaver planning and new massive infrastructures it can house lot of people.

Except that if we build enough small infrastructures and Nepali's structures, it can be a Nepali' city and maybe 1 of unique and most Beautifull in Asia. We need 1 megacity in Nepal which is as big and inhabited as Ktm, but which is worthy, spacious clean, and a city for the normal people and a city that prioritize pedestrians.

But to be a city with as equal inhabitants as Kathmandu we need jobs.

And to not be full of buildings, and still feel spacious, we need to build apartments from now and no independent houses. And while saying apartments you think of earthquake so around max 6 storage broad apartment which will house 300's of people, would be the best option in terms of earthquake resistance and not to expensive as they rise in cost to make when going up.

Also apartments buildings inspired from Barcelona grid but with our own design and corner should be great. As not skyhigh but lower functional apartments are some ugly things to look at when it's a whole neighborhood with only apartments.

**Now how do we get more jobs.** Look Kathmandu is just going to be more packed and packed while we don't have enough capability for all those peoples after some years cause while I am in district of Kathmandu next to municipality and it has some space and open land i think it will be full after some years or 10 cuz of already bad planning and building overall, which takes more land for less buildings.

&#x200B;

Maybe entrepreneurship and business should get a big push from the government and funds.

Also lot of politics being in ktm and business also in ktm is giving those business and there growth a hard time, specially the ones which aren't the biggest to bribe well. The infrastructure and process just works like traffic there. And that is costing money and growth. Specially for new businesses and midsized.

But also, let's shift some industries from Kathmandu to Pokhara. Instead of expanding in Ktm like a new IT office, expand that building in Pokhara, which is easier than in industries that works with goods and factories.

Let's make it beneficial for them to have their next expansion in Pokhara.

Also for this plan.

Let's make Pokhara Airport also an equal option for import and export in terms of cost. Let's eat a bigger cost in the short long-term so that we can enjoy the fruit of it in the long term. So it can be beneficial for huge exporting cooperation to shift to Pokhara and near.

&#x200B;

**But the biggest is the new value and cooperation.**

The biggest reason for a huge rise in jobs should because of local industries, entrepreneurship, and businesses. Let's give them a boost as a government. Like with subsidizing and just playing with relevancy. Just have a long-term plan to make Pokhara a good startup hub, a place with less politics and where it is cheaper to do business cuz of great infrastructures and cuz government white collar worker who knows the work and don't delay and mess for everyone except the big companies. Which gives them more chance to grow faster than in other places.

Let's make Pokhara the easiest city in Nepal which is easiest to do business and where the government also has invested in tools and facility to help them with entrepreneurship and help existing small business. Like an organization that gives advice and helps with taxes. Let's see at infrastructures in Europe that make it easy for entrepreneurs where they can knock when they have trouble with some thing or etc.

**But the biggest way** is by looking at the plans and directions our Neighbours in southeast Asia took. Look at Philippines and Indonesia. Look how they are working with technology and services. And take how they are focusing on things that is relevant and being open to grab opportunities in relevant matters. And understand how those relevant business are connected to society and make a similar environment in terms of efficiency and ability.

The beautiful thing that happened in Philippines and Indonesia is like here everyone lives with technology created by the west.

But they from their local places and society came up with new things and Initiative and converted that in business and solution and created products, cooperation's exports and again better solutions to problems.

And the 2nd beautiful part is some of those are physical products, but it is connected to technology because they have done it in their own way where they left processes and made it cheaper and more efficient. And they have done it not raw or with machine but with help of technology and new small research.

&#x200B;

To come up with that they had a good spacious healthy society.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xftf4k/we_should_change_capital_to_pokhara_i_saw_video/,9/16/2022 14:51,5,0,22,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

rr5i6f,Getting my shit together need advice," Average looking , belonging to middle class family currently 20 doing engineering here in nepal ( 2nd year ) .

1. relationship: Always been a introvert have 2 close friends currently different college, never had anything worth mentioning in love life still to meet anyone worth giving the effort time and care( i had one but was dumb enough to think i stood no chance infornt of those wanna be cool mediocre looking extroverts simping around them which i regret very much after knowing i had the chance and actually the best chance but thats the past ).Nowdays i think having someone to care and care for you would be nice but since i am not good looking enough that someone i like will make the first move nor brave enough to do it myself so here i am .
2. Acedemics: i guess among the top 5% of the students here in nepal. never felt i was weaker than rest have achieved pretty good result when it was needed the most ( regular scholership at ioe government college yet to fail any subject here in engineering ) . one major issue is i kinda move towards next goal way early so stresses me out sometimes which also is my only motivation to study which might not be bad thing but i dont think its good for my mental health . for instance only motivation for me to study is in hope to get good scholership in some reputed college for my masters in usa which i know would not be any different from now if i get in but would bother me for way long if i dont get in . having high expectaion from yourself really hurts.
3. sports: this hurts the most , i was into sports when till class 9 but havent regularly played any sports past 5 6 years. now in college there are opportunities but i am not good enough to actually continue a sports due to around 4 year break so i distanced myself from the grounds and i regret it. i actually was really close to learning basketball at some coaching centre even reached them out but at last gave it up thinking i will just get laughed at as 20 yr old who dont know shit about basketball starting to learn at 20 ( way too insecure about everything) .

what you guys think i should start with to fix my life or do i just leave as it is and just focus on more carrier which i think would regret in future when looking back. the list goes on but these are thngs that currently are bothering me. took me long enough even to post it anonymously so not sure where i will end up in life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/rr5i6f/getting_my_shit_together_need_advice/,12/29/2021 10:52,0,0,30,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

xsvp4n,I might be the worst child my parents would have hoped for,"I am such an ass of an person that its causing me pain to even think.My parents aren't the most literature individuals but they know their way around the life better then me,and there is I a semi-literate person who doesn't even know the surrounding around myself.I just wanted to let some of the things out of my heart cause if i can't i might actually break down and might do something absolutely dumb and pathetic.

&#x200B;

So what i wanted to say is i might not be the child that my parents may have hoped for which is like loving, caring who may help them in their old age which is something i will do but as an obligation, its not like i don't love my parents ,i do but they way they don't expect from their child

&#x200B;

To set things first my parents are the most lovable , caring parents anyone can hope to have might i say a bit too overbearing, overprotective and over expecting but regardless of that i still love them and sometimes i think i am not worthy of that love and it just feels like that love is just being wasted on this ""darthi ko bojh"" aka me.

&#x200B;

I think I have a serious anger management issue where every interaction i have with my parents just end up me getting annoyed with them for no apparent reason and instead of teaching them the way around in this ""modern"" world i get pretty annoyed with them not knowing small mundane things that are related to technology and so on and so fourth. Everytime i get annoyed with my parents or scold them on somethings i get this massive guilty trip like ""what the actual fuck is wrong with you my guy"" and sometime i think i should just leave them and don't give them anymore trouble that i have already giving them but you know what i am too much of a pussy to do that and i am going to make them more stressed then they already are .

Last time I experienced this was when my cousin was in a fight with a drunk stranger. While my brothers tried to separate him, I was just standing at one corner and yelling them to stop. And I was shivering. I am really afraid of fights and arguments, and whenever there is one, I start shaking out of terror (even if I am not in a fight, just watching one stresses me out).

10ip885,A levels and +2,"I was an A levels students that joined the course straight out of Nepali education system. I didn't know much about the course but I knew it would help me study abroad. That was the sole reason I joined it. 

It was a struggle in the beginning. The course wasn't built different but the exams were. Teachers taught us one thing in exam and a question completely unexpected would be on the exam. But isn't that every exam I have given in my life ? Well, it was very different. 

For the very first exam I gave in A levels, I was completely unaware of the question pattern. I just thought I needed to read the notes and I would be fine but I WAS DAMN WRONG. It didn't work like that. Afterwards, I learnt that you need to learn each topic in depth enough to solve any problems regarding it. It could be a topic as easy as gravity and yet Cambridge would still find a way to ask a question so weird that your head would spin trying to come up with an answer.

On top of that the multiple choice questions. One would think they are easy but it is laughable. It didn't matter if the question took one look to solve or 10 minutes to solve, it was rewarded one mark and 40 questions in 60 minutes. Damn !! Time has never passed this fast. The practical papers as fun as they were, finding out errors and what not was not my cup of tea. 

As time passed, I started breaking free of habits I built studying in Nepali education system. I wasn't worried about the next thing that could potentially be in exam. That was because even if you knew the entire syllabus, the questions would still be unpredictable. You could never predict anything at all. No questions from the past paper is ever repeated unless it involves definitions. Each exam I gave during my A levels was equivalent to opening Pandora's box. I started enjoying exams. The questions would always be different so I started testing my knowledge to know how far I could come up with answers. If I couldn't solve them, I would focus on where and why I went wrong. 

I started questioning things. I enjoyed physics for the first time. I started questioning everything and finding out every possibility. Because it's an A levels exam so you can never be too sure on what to expect in exam. It started getting fun. Obviously it is stressful but I enjoyed the process where I wasn't focused solely on getting good grades. Even though grades remained my main goal, learning was never compromised. My focus was never on what comes in exam but what I learned and How I learnt it so I could solve everything in my question paper. 

The courses in A levels isn't as vast as the ones in +2. But they weren't any easy. I have always been a good student or so I thought. Being the first in each school and each class until the end of 10, it wouldn't have been difficult for me to succeed in +2 as well. I am not bragging. Just being realistic. It's not like I wouldn't have struggled studying +2 either cause every sector has its own struggle. But my struggles in +2 would have been the exams itself. And not about what I learnt. 

In the middle of my second year in A levels, I was completely distraught cause I thought I had learnt nothing until that point. I wasn't able to connect one part of physics with another. I failed to make it make sense. I thought I knew nothing. I was angry with myself for living the illusion of learning when I wasn't. I picked myself back on track and made it work. 

My concerns until 10 was exam. Not what I was learning but what would be on exams. What the teacher said about syllabus. It know it wouldn't have changed one bit had I joined +2. I am not saying people in +2 just blindly follow the course either. I am sure there are a lot of people who value learning over exams but how long can those students go if exams and grades are valued over learning ? Are students enthusiastic to know something new everyday? It's difficult to succeed in a system that sets you up for failure. When +2 students were ranting about how chapters that teachers emphasized wasn't on the exam on reddit, it would catch me by surprise. 

A level isn't that great either but it certainly is better than our education system. Science or learning doesn't have to suck. I just want every student to enjoy going through the book, learning and understanding new things. A levels was fun while it lasted. It has helped me turn into a better version of myself and I have never looked back. I have come to love a subject I least expected. I have learnt to be curious again and enjoy exams and studying in general. Plus the teachers were great. They taught you the basics but everything else was upto you and how much work you put into learning and expanding the basics. Learning was like peeling an onion. The teacher just hands you the knowledge aka the onion. You are the one who unravels the layers and everything in between. 

My experience in A levels can be very different to some other people who took it. Its not all fairytale. It is what you make you to be. Another thing is the course itself promoted learning so it was worth every second of 2 years that I spent on it. I am happy I chose it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/10ip885/a_levels_and_2/,1/22/2023 17:38,6,0,10,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

This is however not being implemented in our college. We will also be okay if the college postpones our exam for the time being as this is the peak hour of Covid-19. During our last semester, our college was happily taking exams as well and classes on an online medium. However, despite of the increase in cases among the students, our college is still persisting on taking exams physically. This is also adding mental stress to the students.

I came back and did nothing for first 6 months and than started bussiness etc. there were rough times... specially “Nepali time”  was most irritable part of being back. You call people to do a job and they show up 5 hours late etc.  dust and smoke, dog barking, load shedding etc. but than the fact that I am in my homeland, I am with my brothers sisters, mom and dad is the best part.
There is potential to make more here in Nepal. 
Lot more drama here in Nepal with employees here. 
One thing i worry about is my mom and dad. They are old as fuck and medical facilities is poor and no emergency services.
Wife is struggling in Nepal but she is talkative social butterfly. She does not like social pressure to bid my the rules. I understand her and she wishes to go back deep in her heart. But she tells me she is happy, kisses me to avoid the topic and our life moves on. She is smart and fucking hot . She could have easily married handsome, tall guy who is living in nuclear family in USA. Instead she married this short guy, with wrinkles, anxiety , depression and she still is happy. She tells me I have never yelled at her and she is just glad about it and happy about it. I find it sad because not getting yelled shouldn’t be a hall mark for happy marriage. That is just low expectation. May be deep inside she is as broken as me.
One kid we have is smart. She is happy but when she is few year old, I am sure she will be depressed as everyone else. Goal is to make enough money that atleast she won’t have to worry about money when she is adult... that way one stress of life is gone. She didn’t have choice to be born. We took that decision and I don’t know if it was fair decision to make .

I have few friends and we go and drink / smoke weed . I love this part the most about being in Nepal.

15honnn,Need suggestions,"Hello daju & didi haru,

I find myself in quite a stressful situation. After completing my +2 studies last year, I spent a year doing very little. Initially, I tried preparing for the IELTS exam, but then I started worrying about the challenges of living abroad and the possibility of wasting my parents' money if I didn't get through the embassy's selection process. So, I decided to stop practicing for the IELTS.

Currently, I'm a computer science student with a desire to pursue BScIT. I am considering going to India for my bachelor's education, but I have no idea about the process for Nepali students. I have a few questions:

1. Are there any affordable colleges in Nepal that offer direct admission?

2. Could you please guide me through the process of studying in India as a Nepali student?

3. Are there colleges in India that offer direct admission, or do I need to prepare for an entrance exam? Alternatively, are there any other workarounds for admission?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/15honnn/need_suggestions/,8/4/2023 3:20,3,0,1,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,0,0,0,0,0
g4tevp,Nepali workers stranded in UAE demand their right to return home,"Thousands of Nepalese workers are stranded in the UAE without income and their right to return home is denied by their Government. Nepal is one of the major labor suppliers in the UAE, with 200.000 Nepali living in the country. Those include some whose visas are expired, who lost their jobs or stopped being paid by their employer because of the pandemic. Visa of some Nepalese have expired and some of them have laid off, but their home country is hesitating to take them back as Nepal does not have the capacity to place them in quarantine in its soul. 

According to local reports, there are over 20.000 Nepalese currently working illegally or laid off in the Emirates. Last week Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli held a telephone conversation with Crown Prince of UAE. Prime Minister Oli also discussed the matter of Nepalese migrant workers there. A ministry official told WAM that options currently being studied by UAE include the halting of any memoranda of understanding between the Ministry and the concerned authorities of non-cooperative countries, as well as the introduction of restrictions or quotas for future recruitment.

Although the UAE government has extended the validity of visas, stating that Nepalese workers who have an expired visa will be able to stay in the country without incurring penalties, authorities stressed the urgency of Nepal assuming its responsibilities towards its nationals in the UAE wishing to return back home with their families during the pandemic. The ministry in cooperation with the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the General Civil Aviation Authority, and the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority also launched an humanitarian initiative to enable residents working in the private sector to return to their home countries as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic.

So far, Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli hesitated to lift a plane and evacuate his citizens from UAE, despite the appeals of thousands of families. Nepali authorities have made little provision for returning citizens because they have few facilities to quarantine them. Imposing restrictions without addressing the needs of citizens entitled to return home denies them their basic rights. Nepali health care is already weak in comparison to those of the UAE. If the number of cases increase, it is likely to overwhelm the country’s health care systems. Nepal is ramping up its bid to contain the spread of this devastating virus. The Nepal government extended the ongoing nationwide lockdown to battle the spread of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The government had announced a week-long nationwide lockdown on March 24 in a bid to stop the Coronavirus from spreading out of control. [Nepal has confirmed 30 cases](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/nepal/) and local communities are terrified of the return of workers from abroad who could bring the virus into the country with them. 

Nepal’s government faces huge challenges to keep its people safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its response should not be denying citizens the right to come home. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/31/nepal-abandons-migrant-workers-fight-against-covid-19) recently reported. Although if doesn’t have the necessary resources, Government should organize appropriate places where workers can spend the 14 days isolation recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) before returning to their homes. UAE also made it clear that all countries of foreign workers in the UAE should be responsible for their nationals wishing to return to their countries as part of the humanitarian initiative launched recently by the ministry. The Gulf country is also ready to provide the necessary help as part of the international humanitarian solidarity approach provided since the beginning of the pandemic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kathmandu/comments/g4tevp/nepali_workers_stranded_in_uae_demand_their_right/,4/20/2020 14:07,7,0,1,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

This piece of writing allows us to reflect upon these kinds of instances. I want all of you to imagine one such instance/scenario where you wanted to break down but yet you didn’t. See how strong you are, even stronger than your mind. You just need to believe in yourself. But, I know this whole concept of believing in oneself is lame and boring. By now you must have heard it a million times. Everyone keeps on saying the same thing. Even the person who has his life messed up so badly will suggest you this. Yes, because it is the ultimate truth. We can’t if we don’t try and we don’t try if we don’t believe. 

Me and my friends always in tough situations fool around by quoting something so pleasant to listen to. We state the title **“हिँडे पुगिन्छ”** which is the title of a book. This when translated into English means the walk will reach you there “there” denoting the destination. So, hell yeah do it. Do what you want. No one will be there to push you but thousands to pull you back. Be the decision-maker for yourself. Don't give the control button to your mind and don’t let your fear take the authority.

Kehi galti gare maaf pau.  


I am a Tharu from Dang district. If you don't know about Tharu community, we are the 4th largest ethnic community in Nepal. Historically and presently, we have been one of the most marginalized and poor community. We have our own unique culture. We follow local gods like spirit, ancestors with mix of hinduism.

For past few years i have been noticing influence of christianity in my community, in my village. 5-6 years ago american people used to come to our village. theyd gather villagers, set up some camps for social work and preach christianity parallely. Now they have set up a church in my village and there is a Nepali pastor, a magar guy from rolpa. Americans dont come anymore. I study masters in kathmandu. whenver I go back to my village i see a different change. I see more tharus converting. 30-40% of my village is christian now. there is a new divide in the village, there are arguments and quarrel too for religion which i have never saw before. we worship spirits which we call vuyar, and there has been quarrel and fight because some villagers now say its rakshas puja. there is no big celebration and fun in maghi like before because half of your family dont come to celerate it now. when there is christmas and converted tharu go to rally in Tulsipur bajaar. they are talked bad from village. Tharu are very close community. never seen such divide before. there was no concept of good god and bad god, true religion and fake religion, heaven and hell in my village. but its a hot topic now.

Tharus are innocent and docile community by nature. majority of my villagers are illiterates and depend on working as labourer and farming for living. we have no understanding of the world outside our village. easy to influence i guess. maobadi also recruited tharus in huge number.

i see parbate angry with christian missinoaries. i dont understand what you fear. you have 1.5 billion hindus. your culture, tradition wont get largely affected by christianity. even if all of parbate convert to christianity in nepal, that is drop in the ocean. billion+ in india, crore in bangladesh, indonesia, usa, uk and all over the world. you will remain forever in one form or another. your community is educated and your people are influential positions to fight for your cause.

But we tharus are only 15 lakh. even paschimeli tharus are different in culture, language than purbeli tharu. Our poor, uneducated, innocent community cant stand against a powerful force like christianity with bilions of inernational dollars of funding.

I am not hating christianity and christians. i am sorry if my words hurt you. i only fear for my community.

mevoo6,"Suffering from retroactive jealosy, suspicion and other mental Issues 😢. I fear going into depression😢😟. A good therapist suggestion appreciated.","I got married few months ago with a ""sanskari"" girl: sojho, innocent type.Let me make it clear I didn't bother and never asked anything about her past.During one of few date we went before after our engagement I managed to kiss her and she was really angry.She later told me it was her first kiss and that she never had any physical relationship with any guy during her 30 years.She used to text me before our marriage that she was anxious about her first  night and I reassured that we would only ""do"" once both of us were ready.

Warning """"""some explicit contents ahead"""""":
On the first night after undressing she told me that it was first time that she saw a grown up penis.I didn't believe her and asked her if she didn't ever watch a porn film or picture.She told no.The first three nights we didn't do anything because it hurt her and I didn't want to make love unless she was physically and mentally ready.On the fourth night we ""did it"" and she said it hurt but she enjoyed it too and told me it was less painful than she had imagined.

Fast forward few weeks she told me about her male friends who were her best friends.I took it normal until she told me that she used to recieve gifts from them.She told that almost all cellphones she ever had and even her macbook was gifted by her male friend who considered her like sister.I tried my best not to suspect anything but while on our honeymoon trip she told me about two such friends abroad who were asking what could they gift her or if they could send her money so that she would buy anything she wanted.I wanted to tell her it's not good to accept such gifts or money but didn't want to show that I suspected her so kept quiet.

On the valentine's day she was on facebook when I saw a message from her ""best friend"" abroad wishing her happy valentines day with love emojis and a message just before that complementing her photo.I was curious to know more but I couldn't.

About a month later I managed to find the lock pattern of her phone.I just wanted to make sure if she was really innocent as she sounded or was acting too innocent to hide something from me.Surprise!! She had deleted all her fb messages except of 3 or 4 family members and mine.Same with viber and phone message!!!She had uninstalled imoapp a long time back!!!

I became too curious and suspicious.I tried to look for deleted photos on google photos and found a fb messenger screenshot where she had sent a bedtime selfie to a guy and a another screenshot where the guy used her the same ""unique word"" she used to refer me with.From the screenshot of chat it seemed that she had sent multiple pictures to the guy.

Since then I tried to uncover a part of her past to just verify if she was trying her best to hide something from me or put me in the dark.I felt bad to stalk but I was so much overcome with jealosy and curiosity that I searched her phone activity and facebook search activity.I found that in the past 4 months before our marriage 80% of her searched name was the same guy.Same with the call record that she hadn't deleted.And surprisingly they just talked once after our engagement was fixed.More surprise, a weekback while she was scrolling on her phone and this guy showed up I asked who he was.She told tgat it was a friend like a dai and had put on bhaitika when they were small!!!

Let me make you clear I am not unhappy because she might have had a boyfriend or might have slept with guys before our marriage.I have repeatedly told her that I am not bothered by her past and would be happy to hear her experience.But each time she tries to act that she is the Sanskariest of all girls of nowadays and that she considered relationship before marriage something awful
I am bothered by this double standard of her and day and night obsessed with the desire to find the real truth about her past.Trust me, finding about her past relationships would just make me more happy and I would love her even more.

The problem now is this has led to an OCD like state.I stalk her profile at every chance I get to find more info.I play mental picture of her past with some other guy and immediately remember how sexually innocent she tries to portray herself.I know this habit is making me depressed and distracting me from healthy and productive activities. I even don't feel like making love to her like before. Whether she is a saint or a liar I should not ruin myself.But I cannot think straight.So I need help.I need a therapy.Please suggest me one 😕😢😟😥

I swear again.The day she tells he the truth about her past relationship I would love her more than ever.

THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR WONDERFUL REPLIES.MOST OF YOU HAVE SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD SIT DOWN AND HAVE A HONEST CONVERSATION.SOME HAVE SAID I SHOULD PUT MYSELF IN HER SHOES AND THEN FORGET ABOUT IT.IT IS FOR THIS REASON I WAS SEEKING A GOOD THERAPIST BECAUSE NEITHER DO I WANT TO CONFRONT HER IN A DISTURBED STATE OF MIND  AND RUIN OUR RELATIONSHIP IF IN CASE  SHE CONTINUES PLAYING INNOCENT, NOR DO I WANT TO SUFFEE THIS MENTAL TORTURE.SO I THINK A GOOD PSYCHOLOGIST CAN HELP ME FIND A BETTER WAY OUT.I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY RECOMMENDATION.THANK YOU ALL.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/mevoo6/suffering_from_retroactive_jealosy_suspicion_and/,3/28/2021 5:59,52,0,34,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to reach out and seek some advice regarding a personal issue that has been bothering me lately. Please bear with me as I try to express myself.

I'm in a good relationship with my girlfriend, and I genuinely care about her. However, I sometimes feel insecure about her past experiences, particularly when it comes to her sexual history. I lost my virginity to her, which makes me question my own lack of experience in comparison.

These insecurities can be a turn-off for me, as I find myself constantly thinking about the things she's done with other men before we met. It's a source of anxiety and has made me feel inadequate at times. I even catch myself thinking about cheating, just to see what it's like with other women and maybe boost my confidence. But deep down, I know that's not the right solution.

I understand that these thoughts may not be fair to my girlfriend, and I genuinely want to overcome these feelings of jealousy and inadequacy. I don't want to jeopardize our relationship or hurt her in any way.

I would appreciate any advice, tips, or personal experiences you could share on dealing with these insecurities. How can I address these feelings constructively and maintain a healthy relationship with my girlfriend? I want to learn how to feel confident and secure, valuing what we have rather than dwelling on the past.

1d3cqs4,I got sexually harassed for the first time today.,"I(16F) got touched today by a (17-19M). 

I had always gotten catcalled and looked with dirty eyes as long as I can remember but I had never gotten physically harassed. I always walked with a straight unwelcoming face avoiding eye contact in public and today was the same. 
When I was heading back home from my training, a boy suddenly comes and slaps my behind and runs away. I had never gotten touched like that so for a few seconds I couldn’t even process what was happening. After realizing, I turned around to see that the boy had already ran away. I was shocked and the people around also looked at me but did nothing. I was still shaken up but started walking again, trying to get as far away as I can. After thinking about the situation and what had just happened to me, tears started rolling down my face. I couldn’t control them. I was scared and upset. Why would a teen like me do that, why did I do nothing, why did nobody around me do nothing, why did I have to take that path, why did have to go to training that day. All these sorts of questions started running through my head. I was trying to hold back my tears as much as I could while trying to reach my home quickly. Everything built up and I became overwhelmed with emotions. That 20 minute walk to my home was the longest. People stared at me while I was trying to hide my tears and run away. I just wanted to get home asap and just curl up into a ball and disappear. As soon as I got home, I started balling my eyes out. I don’t know why I cried and me crying made me more upset. I was so upset at my helplessness in the situation. I don’t know what to do if I encounter that boy again. Should I shout, curse, attack him? I haven’t told anyone yet. Idk I just feel so violated. And I feel as if my experience is not even that bad relative to others. I feel like I am overreacting but I just can’t help but feel scared and pathetic. Even during the walk home, I avoided every man I saw and tried to get far from fear. I was always confident that I would speak up if I got harassed but I did the opposite today. And I just don’t know what to do. I want to scratch away the part that I was touched. 
Does anyone know what I should do?

Update: Hello guys! Thank you for all the support, encouragement and comfort. I talked to my mom about the situation today because I gained enough courage from your words. Unfortunately, they didn’t have cctv around the area and I don’t remember much about the harasser since it was my first time seeing him. But I feel much better. Thank you for all your guy’s advice. I’ll make sure to not let that guy go the next time I see him. Even though I can’t reply to every comment I truly am grateful for all the kindness everyone has shown because it has helped me to put this trauma behind me and become more stronger.❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1d3cqs4/i_got_sexually_harassed_for_the_first_time_today/,5/29/2024 13:52,252,0,111,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
o66tm8,Do ncell&ntc fear going broke if market became competitive.,"Mobile data in nepal is considered one of the most expensive in the world and the most expensive in south asia. Or second most expensive depending on if we consider afganistan part of south asia or not.

Lets take a look at ntc, a couple of year ago, ntc was operating at a loss, reason was supposed to be incompetent and ineffective administration and structure. Currently its operating at profit but both revenue and profit is on the decline despite consumer consuming more data.

Nepal Telecom (NTC) had an annual income of NRs 45 billion and 269 million in the Fiscal year 2074/75. Whereas for the FY 2075/76, the income goes down by 4% to NRs 43 billion and 482 million. Out of the total income, the income from its customers decreases by NRs 2.3 billion but there is a slight increment of income from other sources like the bank interests.

Also net profit in 75/76: 10arba, 74/74: 17 arba.


For ncell too their revenue and profit are decreasing despite increase in consumption of their service. https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2021/02/ncell-revenue-declines-by-12-5-billion-2020-despite-data-increase.html

I think this is consistent when the decrease in data prices in nepal and more economic voice and data package. This begs the question. Some another carrier provider provides a cheaper service.

1gxtu0q,"""I Swapped Exam Papers to Help My Friend, and Now I Regret It""","A few months ago, during our final exams, one of my closest friends was in serious trouble. He’s always struggled with studies, and if he failed this time, he’d be kicked out of school. He was desperate, and I could see the fear in his eyes. Right before the exam started, he begged me to help him.

At first, I said no—I didn’t want to cheat. But during the exam, I noticed he was totally panicked and staring blankly at his paper. I don’t know what came over me, but I made a split-second decision. I swapped our answer sheets.

I finished writing his paper as fast as I could, then scribbled something on mine. When the results came out, he passed with decent marks, but I failed. My parents were furious. They couldn’t understand how I could mess up so badly in a subject I’d always been good at.

Here’s the worst part: my friend didn’t even thank me. He acted like he deserved it and said, “You’ll pass next time, don’t worry.” The more I think about it, the angrier I get. I ruined my own record for someone who doesn’t even care.

Now, I’m stuck retaking the exam, lying to my parents about what really happened, and wondering if I even did the right thing.

He took all of lives in his hand and drove for 11 years. I know Nepali don't have habit of saying thank you but at least say something like ""la hai gurujee"" , ""la lagiyo hai"", ""la ta hai"" or ""danyavad dai"" .   
2) Morning walk ma hineko pari bata ekdam sahariya type ko keti aayo, I am not that bad looking too....if not handsome , I definitely don't look like a thief or pervert. I said her ""good morning"" as she was straight in front me. She was like ""malai chineko ho ra?""   
3) ma taxi driver ni ho ( pathawo wala , just to meet some random person not as my main profession), there was this lady ( merai age ko 35 around), I said ""bye movie enjoy garnuhola"" with smile to her as she was the one paying me the money and her husband gave me bad look as if I am trying to flirt his wife.

16ywbtu,There has been a sudden increase in communal voilences in terai of nepal. And I seriously doubt this all is planned.,"I come from terai reason and though I have been living in ktm now the stories and news of there always reach me here mostly because my family is a big and many lives in different places.. So, what I have noticed in our talks lately is the growing tension between the hindu and muslim communities.. Like not everything is about the violence but I could really sense discomfort and change in attitude towards muslim... Also I have grown up in locality where there is a significant Muslim population (25 percentage maybe) so I have good number of Muslim friend as well and when talking to them I also get the news of the communal incidents and sometimes fear... Like 6 7 years ago when I used to live there I never remember any communal things happening.... So I can't wonder but ask why are there sudden increase in communal incidents and is this all planned?? 

Well why I am writing this post today? because my cousin lives in Nepalgunj and curfew is going on there because of hindu muslim violence. Well my brother in law has a business in Nepalgunj and it was really affected by this.. And when I asked her, she told me some videos surfaced in internet which made calls for hindu akta because in the video it was showing some Muslim saying worst things and so the video asked violence against them. Some reported the videos but they were too slow to take down and it reached people and when authorities took action it increased the violence..... Also few days back I had heard news about violence during the krishana Janmasthami.. Yahi Reddit ma last Thursday(I guess), there was a post about communal violence. ( and man some of comment  there, were really showing how much intolerance have grown even on youths ).. So seeing all this events I really think this all is been done deliberately so that us versus them narrative can be created and politics can be done on this . 

Nepal ma there is already so many problems.. Mahangai, berojgari , corruption lai ta we are not able to Slove.. Please don't let this happen here as well. Also although many such incidents has happened there is not much talk going on about this on national level so let's not ignore this.. Because this is like a cancer if we ignore it here soon it will reach every part and destroy our nation.

1h8syny,It was a bad day.,"I am not confident. I like to hide my face. I avoid looking in the mirror.  I don't remember when was the last time I looked myself in the mirror. I remember that one time I had to go to a school function ani there was this, mirror in front of us when using the stairs, I just looked down while climbing or in my home I just look the other side of the mirror direction. I just avoid it. I don't wanna look at my face. Yup you guessed it right, it's ugly.

I was talking to my friend, who convinced me not to wear a mask everywhere I go. I trust her. Following her advice, the next day, I wasn't wearing a mask to hide my face. I was insecure at that time, but I was trying to face my fear.

Anyways, Hijo asti ko kura ho. I was in college ani some guys were talking who were sitting behind me. One thing led to another and one of my classmate who was sitting behind me asked, ""Kasko anuwar chor jasto xa"" ani without any hesitation about 2 or 3 people said my name. It broke my heart. I was hurt. But I acted like nothing happened. Even tho teacher gave us a work to do, I couldn't do it. I wanted to reach for my mask but couldn't.

I know it might sound like nothing to whoever reading this, but it was like a nail in the coffin. It took a lot of effort to mustard that courage to not put on a mask. 

I know I am ugly. I got face that I am convinced even myself is unworthy to see, unpleasant to eye. I am so ugly that I myself don't look at mirror.

1br44n2,Unpopular Opinion: Nepal is at its best and is rapidly progressing,"While living in Nepal, it might not seem so but Nepal has taken tremendous strides in the last decade. And no these are not mere results of technological advancements spilling over to Nepal. I lived abroad for almost a decade so I can see the before/after effect with great clarity.

Few of the things I noticed/learnt about that are extremely impressive: 


1. Huge hydropower boom: When the left the country, we had loadshedding for 18 hours! Now loadshedding is non-existent. More importantly, how we got rid of the loadshedding is even more impressive. We added over 2000 MW of electricity production the last decade. Upper Tamakoshi the largest Hydro till date was completely financed from domestic sources. Last year alone 500 MW of electricity came into production from private sector! Largest was 86 MW project in Solu Khola. These are massive undertakings from private sector. 5000 MW is in the pipeline. These are not some abstract ideas, hydro dream is happening and will bring in billions of dollars. Yes the wealth will be concentrated but it will greatly remedy the issue of trade imbalance present currently.

2. Tourism and hotel industry: When I left, Soaltee, Hyatt, Radisson were the international names and were barely surviving. Now there are many international chain hotels and 26 new five star hotels are opening up all over the country. Many international chains have come up in Nepal. Mariott, Holiday Inn and many more. Over a million tourist in 2023 and this year already a rise of 30%. If Balen delivers and Kathmandu gets dust/smoke free tourists will quadruple easily.

3. Huge boom in restaurants and international cuisine: Any type of food I can get abroad barring beef I can easily get it here in Nepal and the quality of food is awesome too. I pretty much ate anywhere and everywhere and did not fall sick. General hygiene seems to have improved a lot over the years.

4. General boom in technology: Cheapest internet, almost universal adoption of e-payments. 

5. Vibrant media: Believe it or not, most media in western countries are mouthpieces for their political parties or donors. Its blatant and they don't even hide it. I find the media in Nepal to be a lot more unbiased. I am not saying they are perfect, far from it actually but I would pick a Nepali media over Fox news any day.

Now if things are getting so much better, why is everyone leaving the country? Obviously it does not apply to everyone and there is genuine hardship here but many are leaving due to FOMO. I have talked to many who had not an iota of thought about leaving this country few years back are leaving now because others are leaving. But many are staying back too. I have friends who have thriving career/business and will not leave this country for any reason and I can totally see why.

Again this post is not intended to minimize anyone's hardship/suffering in this country. Its still a poor country with many challenges. I am putting it here to share some optimism and hopefully encourage those are staying back that things are getting better and will most likely get a lot better.

Someone just mentioned that these are not significant changes and will not be able to withstand remittance bubble collapse. First I do not agree, remittance is not a bubble. It wont pop like a crypto rug pull. It might dwindle down over time gradually but will take decades. If anything it will go a lot higher before falling. 

Secondly, hydro and tourism revenue is massive! Selling 10000 MW hydro to India alone will bring in several billion dollars. Remittance today is over 10 billion dollars but hydro alone will bring in half of what remittance does by 2030. Tourism will bring in another few billion. And we are talking about 10000 MW. If we max out the capacity over time, it will be tens of billions. Also these are not hypothetical plans. 5000 MW is already under development by private sector and we all know private projects do complete in Nepal unlike government projects.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1br44n2/unpopular_opinion_nepal_is_at_its_best_and_is/,3/30/2024 0:22,107,0,91,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

1gflg3w,The Hidden Struggles of Migrant Workers in the Overseas Scam Industry: A Personal Story of Survival and Regret,"In 2021, I left Nepal and went to Dubai to work in a car wash. Life was tough; I was struggling every day. One day, I met a stranger who offered me a job outside of Dubai. He said it was in Myanmar, but he didn't explain what the work involved. Desperate for a better life, I agreed and traveled there, only to realize it was part of a scam operation. When I refused to participate, they threatened to tear up my passport, leaving me with no choice but to work. I was paid $1,500 monthly, but the conditions were brutal: 18-hour shifts for six straight months. Despite the pay, I felt miserable, trapped, and constantly regretting my decision.

Later, I learned that the agent who had taken me from Dubai had sold me for $9,000. After six months in Myanmar, the same company sent me to Cambodia to continue the same work. Every day, I felt deeper regret, questioning why I’d gotten myself into this. My family back home believes I’m a senior graphic designer because I used to work for a media company in Nepal. I’ve kept my real work a secret, fearing their disappointment and anger if they found out. But how long can I keep this up? I’m almost four years into this work, and I feel hopeless about my future.

There are around 20,000 people from my country working in different companies here, and while some say they’re happy, I wonder how long this illusion of happiness will last. I fear the consequences if this all falls apart.

14j7z2a,Overtreatment by doctors. Doctors/Hospitals are the new scammers.,"Recently I had an injury during Futsal. My ankle got twisted or something. I went to get checked up at B&B and the doctor said I needed to have a surgery. I inquired about the surgery and they said that the basic package was about 1.2 Lakhs and premium was about 1.5 Lakhs or something (medicine not included). 

I asked around for a second opinion and one of my friends who was doing internship at a Hospital told me that I didn't need to have a surgery according to the X-Ray. I took care of the injury for about 2-3 weeks and I'm fine. This incident has made me skeptical of all doctors. I don't even wanna go to a hospital if something happens in the future.

I've also heard a lot of complaints from my sisters about baby deliveries that they make you take over treatments praying on our fears. ""Swastha vanda thulo kei hunna. Ek choti test garde duka"" when there is nothing wrong with that part of the body. One hospital even burned one of my sisters baby by feeding her hot stuff that she couldn't handle and wouldn't let us see her for days due to their mistake. Finally, after threatening to take legal actions, they admitted their mistake.

Similar case with my father. Had a prostate problem and they recommended a neuro doctor and an MRI for no reason. No tests had suggested any problems with the nervous system.

Doctors are the new scammers.

Edit: There seem to be a lot of doctors and doctors sympathizers here. I want to state a simple fact, ""All alkali are base and not all base are alkali"". Get on it business students. Do a sincere research and publish it.

1cdjs7s,"Street dogs problem, hypocrite activists ","Street dogs are becoming a huge problem on the streets. Barking and getting aggressive at random people, causing fear & accidents also random bites for no reason. 

If we decide to take any action, as little as even kicking them then hypocrite activists arrive shouting animal rights, who will then go on to enjoy killing and eating animals in their chicken and mutton dinner. Y'all ain't animal lovers, you're hypocrites. 

Somehow if a street dog barks at us and threatens to bite little children, it's our fault ( hypocrite logic) the animal is apparently 'agitated' so the behavior is justified. If the animal is agitated then we gotta make arrangements for them to get the f out of here. Kukur Lai ni Ananda Hamilai pani Ananda. 

These wannabe dog lovers will only come to their senses when their loved ones get viciously attacked. Kukur dekhne bittikai fake ""alelelelele"" is extremely cringe and shows humanity failed as a species. Keep eating meat and hating insects and other forms of animals you wannabe hypocrites

yxjvk2,UNCLE AUTISM Pg#1 : Confessions about a Popular Singer,"Lately, I've been listening to Sajjan Raj Vaidya's songs & they're pretty good. It's like his voice & songs are so good that u don't ever get tired of listening to them over & over. Definitely would've been one of my favourite singers of this era. Unfortunately, it's not that way bcuz I went to the same school & class as him, oh no.

&#x200B;

For a good part of my school life in AVM Higher Secondary School (upto SLC), I ended up in the same class as him due to how the school used to group students based on how good they are academically, he & I had similar results in school exams, which was among the better of the batch, so out of 250 or so students in the same ""year"", I & him, along with 40-50 other students would end up in the ""A Section"" of the ""Class"" (where the best students academically would be placed).

&#x200B;

Because of my various mental problems, such as autism, I had great difficulty speaking & socialising as a kid in school. I was a quiet kid, I never spoke to anybody, I never made any friends, I was a ""loner"". So obviously the other kids in the class/school would make fun of me, tease me, bully me because of my ""quietness"". I really didn't like that.

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to single out Sajjan Raj Vaidya, or say that he is a bad person or so on; he was just a kid then, a normal kid (unlike me). & like all other normal kids of the class he'd pick on me, mock me, make fun of me, even bully me, or egg on other classmates as they mocked & bullied me, because doing so was ""fun"" for them & made their day. Worse still, in those days we came & went to the school on the same school bus, so like with class, they'd make fun of me for their own amusement there as well. I don't want to remember those days. They were like animals. They treated me like a cripple. It was horrible.

&#x200B;

Because of these things, it's hard for me to see him in any good light. He was one of the bad things from my childhood. When I hear that these batchmates of mine have become someone ""great"" or done something ""good"", like in this case, my immediate feelings are sadness & anger. How the hell are these people even allowed to be this ""good""? What is wrong with this world?

&#x200B;

Back in 2014 when I'd just made my facebook account, I found his facebook profile at one point (thanks to his school friends). So I harassed him a couple of times by sending him degratory messages on facebook. I didn't do this out of revenge; I did it simply bcuz it was fun. It was really fun. Needless to say, he didn't take it well, so I stopped harassing him out of fear of the police, the mundrey gundas, among other things. But it was fun while it lasted, pure dopamine.

&#x200B;

He's not the only ""school friend"" I've harassed on facebook tho. I had fun with others as well.

&#x200B;

Now this makes me wonder, just like him, how many of the musicians whom I like listening to, have these shady bits unknown to me & you, I mean, that Karan from Voice Season 4 looks like he'd bully me if he & I were still kids. I don't like that guy one bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/yxjvk2/uncle_autism_pg1_confessions_about_a_popular/,11/17/2022 7:31,83,0,115,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
xgdjn7,Sathi sanga paisa uthaunu paryo,"One of my +2 room mate went to Australia and I helped him throughout his bachelor in assignments and Exams and he used to pay for that(in time he had to another assignment to complete until his final sem). I helped him complete his 8th sem exam in January(bunking offices to attend his exam) and he owes me 30k nepali for the help I did. He told me to wait until June/July as he has to spend on visa. After that he stopped replying my calls and messages when I was in so much need of that money. Recently I am in even more need of that cash , and I used to message him everyday for past 10 15 days and he never replied. Since I had all the assignments I have done for him in my pc , and access to his student portal, i wrote him a long message ""I have waited 8 months for the cash , if you don't pay the sum to me now, i will send the evidence to your college and you will be proven of guilty"".  I thought he would pay me now but what he did was told me ""Thulo kura nagara, even what i have paid you in past is more than you deserve"" and blocked me. His message pissed me. What should i do now , should i do? Should i let him go or mail his college and professor all the evidences?

(He was a good friend from past and mailing college about that might cause serious consequence to him, i just wanted to show fear him to give me money, but now there are only two ways, feel used by him and do nothing or watch him being punished by college(i dont know what college will do or they wont do anything))",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xgdjn7/sathi_sanga_paisa_uthaunu_paryo/,9/17/2022 5:20,74,0,123,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,0,2

Our politicians are without vision and only focused on staying in power. We have been through 30 years of chaos in every sector. And scary part is , we are still 7 to 10 years away from hitting rock bottom. Imagine the situation then!!

15tpph2,Nepal will get there. Slow & steady.,"There are a lot of positives for our country to take after 2046. A few of my experiences and findings recently:

1. Quality of life

It has improved overall. I recall days when fan and black and white television was the only luxury available in the 90s. There was no electricity, mud road, no internet , telephone or schools with better infractures in our village until 2056 Bs. And my village lies in Siraha district, just 3 kilometres from Mahendra Highway. 

People could not afford clothes, food and there were less jobs. You could tell from appearance who was financially sound!

That was the reason i did my schooling from jhapa. Jhapa in 2057 BS was a disaster. I recall we had to wait 2-3 years to get a landline. Roads inside chandragadi or bhadrapur were disaster slimed 1 feet during rain. I had to walk along with my bicycle and went school in slippers with rainfall!

Biratnagar was a bit better but gaighat, lahan, rajbiraj, sindhuli and janakpur were similar. I was lucky to live in multiple cities. 

I recall holidays given due to flooding in biratnagar. This was 2063 BS.

2. Income of people

This has changed a lot after democracy. People are allowed to express themselves. Carry on business themselves. Earlier, business would be a dream unless you had someone in government to facilitate you.

Foreign employment almost non existent until early 50s. Government would send a few select to handful of countries. One of my brother was lucky to get selected to work in kuwait in govt quota. I dont know how much he earned but he bought gifts for almost 100 people when he came. Around our place, we could not get fancy things at all! 

I recall studying per capita of nepal around $400 usd. This has changed a lot. Thanks to our now crippled but much needed democracy!

3. Maoist insurgency

I have seen army randomly kidnap people. And maoist as well.

It was in 2060 when i was travelling with my mom, two guys, masked with BORA in their head with handcuffs were loaded in our seats when we went outside for something. Later to discover they were alleged maoists and were taken for custody by 11-12 army in civil dress. This was inside public bus!

1000s of maoists and army policemen lost lives and government would not even play the news or let others play it.

We used to play in mechi stadium evenings after school. I recall once being sent off early by army officials without any reasoning. One person even pointed gun at us one day! We ran away in fear, of course. That was first time we were held at gunpoint. Turns out that guy was an army official. Even today, i do not have much respect for police and army officials. I have seen them do horrible things!

This was state of cities. I ve heard a lot worst about villages at the time, not worth writing it down. It was direct rule of KING. It was a nightmare. I oppose kingship in any form even now. Nepal was a disaster for 10 years. And the state is equally responsible!

4. Education

Infrastructures have gotten better and better with technology compared to past. More people have reach to schools and education. This has increased literacy rate. You can check the facts.

More people go for foreign universities. Eventually this is bound to benefit Nepal.

5. Other noticeable developments

People flocking for foreign employments. Emergence of private sector. Access to international brands with emergence of globalization.

 Hospital access to people in democracy is noteworthy. Not enough but has improved reasonably. I have seen/heard people die due to piles, tuberculosis , malaria or typhoid.

Upliftment of scheduled class, aboilishment of human slavery and increment of salary of blue collar people are also noteworthy. Credit goes to maoists!

6. Future in my eyes

I still believe that with right kind of leadership Nepal will not take long to move along with two largest and fastest growing economies.

I see Rabi and CK raut as prime force to instill this change. I strongly believe they should come together to gain 80-90 seats in 2084. And no matter what all of us should blindly support them instead of congress and communists who want KAKISTOCRACY for forseeable future. Gagan thapa as congress chair would be the perfect catalyst. 

Hats off to prachanda. He is not flawless but current developments against corruption are amazing after a long long time.

Harka, balen and hamal (farwest) have made us believe what can be done and achieved in a short span of time.

Imagine the start with Rabi, swarnim, ck raut and gagan in the same team. They have that extreme urge in moving nation forward. Corruption will 60-70 % eliminated within 1-2 yrs when this team comes forward.

I am not against people leaving for education or employment or immigration. Eventually with nepal heading in right direction, these people will be the ones to offer whatever they can. Right now, people are doing whatever they can to build them a future. 

I hope we do keep a check on ultra nationalism and improve our democratic practices. Rise above caste , culture , creed and religion to move in right direction. The right time is now!

2084 is the chance for people to manifest that Nepal wants to head in right direction. Nepal wants freedom. Nepal wants to move forward. Nepal wants democracy. 

We will get there. Jay Nepal!!!

183dt7m,Do you agree Tiktok should be banned if you dont use it or would not want anyone close to use it?,"Tiktok is bullshit zombiefying our new generation. It has helped many people prosper over majority who do nothing but wasting time.

I would at any point happily block Tiktok from my home network including other shit like Youtube shorts and Instagram Reels and any other shit like it. But then who am I to block it in your home network? Who am I to block it in my neighbour's network?

So its kind of confusing if I agree or not, not that it matters anyways I am not Durga Prashain and noone would listen to me. But if I have to say, would I be for or against it?

Lets look at it another way, Government said Tiktok. They did not say short video platforms. This will give unfair advantage to other platforms which is very against fair business. This decision came out of nowhere which is also another red flag.

After Tiktok ban, like many people in the nation used ways to bypass such as using custom resolvers. Some people used VPNs. This shows that this rule is against 80-90% of citizens. This is weird for a democratic nation? I am not one of them because I dont need Tiktok. When people ask me how I use internet and I tell them I neither use custom DNS nor any VPN or other shit, they look at me confused.

Even kids know how to use VPN and Tor and other powerful anonymizing tools. Not everyone will use that knowledge for good. I fear some 15-16yo is gonna publish nude of their classmate over a very secure VPN and our cyber bureau wont be able to catch it. This has always been happening but these kids were stupid and naive so they were easily caught. Now, all these powerful tools are accessible and easy to use for them.

vrm824,Some space facts that I would want to share with Nepalese brothers and sisters..,"1.  Universe is huge and let us put it to a scale that we are familiar with... NASA voyager spacecraft can travel at speed of 18km/s that's like moving from dulikhel to Rantnapark in 1.5 sec and despite such tremendous speed it would take voyager spacecraft at least 80,000 years to reach nearest star...



2. The ring system that mankind have always wondered in Saturn is formed in recent times (maybe hundred of thousand or million years old).. it is speculated that one of the moons of Saturn likely violated Roche's limit and tidal force of saturn just shattered it to a pieces... Our own moon is 300,000 km away from earth and if it were to venture within 13000km distance then earth's gravity would shatter it to a pieces and we would have nice ring like Saturn... 



3. Let us also not forget how brilliant our ancestors were .. we mapped entire sky with weird shapes called as constellation... And our ancestors figured out that some dots in sky move erratically between those shapes and they were labeled as planets...



4. For most of the history of mankind we used to get scared with comets ☄️... It was labeled as God's way of telling I am angry or similar kinda things.. and our fear just grew stronger when in around 1600s great fire destroyed entire london city after it's aftermath.. just a weird coincidence huh? But soon after, the friendship between Issac Newton and Edmund halley  paved the path to escape from this boundary of superstition and fear...



5. Some of the stars that we see in night sky might be dead... Because light travels at finite speed... to look across space is to look back in time and there is a limit to how far, back in time can we look...



6. The difference in gravity within small region around black hole is so huge that if astronomers are to stand in it's vicnity the difference in gravity between astronomers head and leg would stretch him like 35km long and his width will be similar to that of hair and despite that if he survived he can see entire future of universe with his eyes ...

Edit: NATO is not the sole reason for russia to attack ukraine. Know this, that putin thinks ukraine as a former part of Russia and wants to take it back.  Ukraine trying to join NATO just gave Russia a reason to attack Ukraine.


Another thing, NATO has 30 members countries which requires concensus for any decision making. So, US alone doesn't have all the power and cannot attack Russia let alone interfere with its internal matter.

1acaq3h,I am spending too much money on cigarettes,"Let me tell you the story of how I started.

I have been a total introverted guy since childhood, I have stayed away from home for studies since 9th grade staying with relatives, And I have gone to picnics just 3 times to date when I was in 7th grade, 8th grade, with friends and school teachers and in 12th grade with just friends.

Now in this picnic of 12th grade, I wanted to taste Alcohol and get a little drunk. Told my best friend about this and yeah I tested Alcohol for the first time and got a little too drunk. Now, I also remember asking other classmates to teach me how to smoke cigarettes.

Fast forward to about 2-3 weeks after the picnic from nowhere I wanted to smoke again. I went out saying I had to buy some pen paper shit to my relatives, and somehow I had the courage to go into a Kirana store and ask for a cigarette.

The same day at midnight I went to the roof, lit that cigarette, and started smoking, The first few puffs were terrible then I got the rhythm. I didn't even complete the whole cigarette, just smoking about half of the cigarette and my legs were shaking like crazy. Then I just threw the cigarette, stayed on the roof for about 30 min, and went to bed.

Now I had bought a cigarette on my own and smoked it. I started smoking once every 2 weeks and not even the whole cigarette, just the half. It was the same for about 5-6 months still couldn't finish a whole cigarette on my own so I would just keep the half and smoke it later.

During this time I was preparing for my board exam when the coronavirus hit, I went home then for a whole year I didn't smoke a single cigarette. My father also smokes cigarettes so had this thought a few times of just sneaking 1 cigarette from dad's pocket and smoking it but there was also this thought saying dude don't get into this kind of shit, it's gonna give you cancer, but the thing that stopped me from stealing a cigarette from dad's pocket was the fear of dad knowing that I smoke.

Now after 1 year, the lockdown has ended I completed +2, and now it was time for my bachelor's.

I had decided whatever I studied I was going to stay alone and not with some relatives cause I wanted to force myself to talk to people and once in a while get out of the room. Cause during that lockdown when I went home none of our neighbors knew that I was home for about a few months. Only when the stores were allowed to open for 4 hrs from 6 AM till about 10 AM during the lockdown and I was helping in my parent's store all of the neighbors were like लौ यो कैले आको थीयो ??

So I did that I joined CSIT, started staying alone, and then another 6 months of lockdown. Now it was a total of 1.5 years without a single cigarette, and even before that, it was just 1/2 cigarette every 1/2 week. There's no way I would get addicted to smoking cigarettes right ??

Wrong. After this second lockdown and I was staying alone out of nowhere I had the urge to smoke a cigarette so I went to the Kirana store near my room, bought 1 Shikhar ice, came to my room, lit it up, and smoked it, I also vomited after the cigarette, So I hated that so fucking much but not for long nope nope… just after a week I was buying cigarettes again. And still, I couldn't smoke the whole cigarette once so 1 cigarette would go for 2 days and it was 1 cigarette a week.

Fast forward to now, 1 pack of cigarettes lasts for just 2 days, and I have no idea how this got so bad.

Have any advice on how I can quit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1acaq3h/i_am_spending_too_much_money_on_cigarettes/,1/27/2024 13:22,28,0,47,English and Nepali,1,0,1,0,1,2
13pgiu6,Do you guys think in a similar fashion or am I just a weird mf?,"So what happened today was. I hop on the Bus back to my home. but to my surprise, it takes a wrong turn from its usual route. and i got worried but remembered that the road to newroad was clear of the traffic. and I thought to myself, that maybe it's that VIP enroute situation. due to which they might have blocked the main road. and the driver must be taking a detour from the adjacent road. but again, to my Suprise, he took the opposite turn of what he was supposed to. and now we are moving in the opposite direction of where we are supposed to go.

by then, my brain is fired thinking about the possibilities of reasons. and i thought that maybe he wanted to make a circle to gather more passengers but then again, the Bus was almost full. maybe he forgot something back there. but he can come later too. and then it dawned on me. what if this is some attempt at the life of some VIP. and this are some terrorist operators. and there is a 500 kg bomb back in the trunk. and they are chasing the vehicle of the VIPs. they will ram themselves into the convoy and blow themselves while blowing us in the process.

I know that is not likely. Since something has never occurred in Nepal.  but still i can't completely deny that possibility too. suddenly i start fearing for my life. am i ready to die? what can i do here? why isn't everyone else doing anything? or even asking questions? i can just go and tackle the driver and restrict him up. or if i see something sus i can jump off the vehicle. but will I survive it? and then I start imagining the ways i can jump off a vehicle going up at high speed with the best probability of surviving. however, since the possibility of it happening wasn't that high. and if I end up beating up the driver and the situation didn't end up being as I imagined it to be. It will be really really awkward afterwards.

so, I didn't do anything and just stayed in my seat. accepting my death. at the moment, I was okay with dying. I had accepted it with open arms as I was envisioning myself dying on a big explosion. don't think I will survive that. but what would be the best way to go here. and how would it feel? but as it turns out they went in a circle. I still don't know why? and now, I wonder how many people in the bus were thinking the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/13pgiu6/do_you_guys_think_in_a_similar_fashion_or_am_i/,5/23/2023 6:44,30,0,72,English,1,0,0,0,0,2

For 'amritsar massacre', It is said that the 'Colonel Dyer' specifically chose Gurkhas for their proven loyalty. So they won't hesitate to shoot thousands innocent civilians.

1bmnwn4,I don't deserve to be happy,"I've been putting off this rant for a while now but tonight I think I'm sinking back into reality and I just have to push it all out. A couple days ago, this account turned a year old, which I had created just for the purpose of venting out and getting on with life. I thought I'd put up one or two of these and then I'll be able to fend off negative thoughts but a year later, this throwaway has still not been deleted, which is a testament to the zero progress I've made in these countless days.

This rant might be a long one as well, but it will have a TL;DR at the end just like my other posts. If you decide to read it all, I'm very thankful to you. I don't know whether anyone will relate with this, but it's just what I am, and what I've become over the years, so please bear with me.

No I wasn't abused as a child, I've never hard soul crushing heartbreaks, nor have I suffered some very deep trauma that could make my psychology act this way, then why can't I seem to be normal? What part of being human am I missing? Lately while scrolling social media, I noticed the algorithm had shifted my feed content to the ""mental illness"" side of humor. After hours upon hours of research and reading people's comments/reading their stories, I felt like I have never faced the background and the hardships those people have been through, and yet why has my mind supposedly been affected by the same elements?

Sometimes it feels like I am just a failed experiment of people trying to create a human, with a few missing features. I have everything a sane person could ask for, a family that has provided for me since my inception, a well working physically non deficient body, access to all the basic human needs. I don't know how my life so far has been different from other people around me, since I was practically raised with those same people. In that case, why don't I understand anything the way anyone else does? No one has told me I have infirmity or I'm just slow minded. SOMEBODY had to have noticed this by now right? But then again, the reason probably is that my academics have never been too bad. After all, our society has a tendency to associate wisdom and knowledge with the percentage we get in school.

If this is the first time you're reading my yapping (I think that's what someone said in the last rant's comments) , I'm 20M. I'm studying undergraduate right now in Nepal away from my hometown, because even though I couldn't gather enough guts to seek studies abroad after grade 12, I couldn't just stay at home forever and expect anything to change. Apart from that, there were no colleges in my hometown that taught my current course. It's already been two years and my expectations regarding personal development during undergraduates have been shattered a million times over.

I get stuck in my mental bubble way too much, weighing myself down. I'm not motivated or disciplined, no matter what I do, no matter how much I set my mind to the theme of bettering myself, I resort back to the same destructive habit cycles again and again. I wanted to go out after bachelor's with hopefully\* enough maturity to be able to handle my life by myself, but looking at my current state, with average grades, not nearly enough competency in any basic skills of my domain, basically zero research idea, non existent networking circle, and a severe lack of soft skills, I'm afraid whether that dream would turn into reality or not. And what if it didn't? What could I do in Nepal? I have no confidence in my ability to make a living right now.

Ever since I was a kid, I haven't had the same quantity NOR the quality of friends as did basically everyone. All my interactions would end with an introduction. I had never been of any use to them, and I never asked anyone for help because I've had a very weak ego and I couldn't risk being humiliated or ridiculed, mostly because there was nobody to back me up. Whatever ""friends"" I had, or at least thought I did, ended the same day that high school exams ended. I see everyone sharing their stories on social media, sometimes like and even comment, but I don't think I've had anyone reaching out after parting ways once. I know nothing is permanent, but I see/hear everyday how long ""temporary"" is too. I'm not saying I deserve any of that. I'm flawed in more ways than one, that must be the only plausible explanation for this. How could I deserve normalcy when I'm subpar. **How could I deserve to be happy? I'm not you.**

I even got into nicotine addiction because it has so far been my only shot at human interactions, just sitting with classmates and ""yapping"" through the blaze and smoke. It is then that I realize how far behind I am. I've been hearing this phrase ""don't compare yourself with others"" for a very long time, but I wonder how it is even possible. Can a person who doesn't have anything be truly not jealous hearing about anything at all? No matter how much I try to convince myself saying ""my path is mine alone, I can't compare with them"" but where has it got me so far.

When talking to someone, there must be something to talk about right? All I know are random facts about squirrels and theories on human psychology. I have an EQ of a stingfish. Once someone I knew casually said ""This is why you're single"" but I don't understand where I chose the wrong path to be this unlikeable. I've been a part of many pursuits up until maybe a year ago, but then I've stopped even giving it a thought. I had no other choice but to accept that I'm just not cut out for deep, meaningful, fulfilling, caring human relationships. I try to keep all this pessimism in myself but I'm letting it all out here because the platform is anonymous. If you knew me in real life, you probably wouldn't be able to guess I could harbor these thoughts too. But that's probably because nobody is close enough to know me that personally.

And before you point it out, it's not like I haven't tried being honest. Every time I've tried to express my self the way I see me, the only answer I've got is ghosting. And that is from people who I considered close enough to show that side of me. I can't help feeling envious of basically everyone around me, not that I think everyone has their life sorted out. I know everyone is going through their own set of struggles, but it pains me to see that I haven't and probably will never have similar problems because I'm just not on the same level.

I'm not a ""sad"" person. But that's probably because I don't know how to define sad, or because I think I'm better than that. This is where my problem arises. Since my childhood, I've been telling myself I'm arrogant and I need to work on it. But everything I try to do to address the issue merely exacerbates it to a higher extent rather than getting better at it. I sometimes think I have to learn humility, but then at other times I think how it is even possible to be pretentious when there's literally nothing I have to show for myself or my pseudo-superiority. I'm not the top percentile in anything I have ever set my hands on, so how could I ever have been arrogant to begin with?

Over the past years, I've tried lots of self diagnose and identify what I could work on, and one think I have noticed is that I'm just way too *lato* for a lack of a better word. I think of everything objectively. I don't have the same level of humor as anyone, and it's not that I get offended at jokes or anything, I just am not as spontaneous as I'd want myself to me. I set myself a target that I'd become more extroverted by the end of bachelors, but every time I try to socialize, I don't get anywhere closer to my goal than I was yesterday. I can't think of silly things mid conversations or occasionally tease others. Nothing comes to my mind at all.

I've listened to advices like ""just be in the moment don't think too much"". I only reflect on everything later, I never think. It still hasn't been working out. Subjectivity is one of my biggest weak points. I don't feel the happiness or joy in things that I see normal humans enjoying. I don't have anything that could instantly light up my day. I haven't ever found a remedy to this overthinking dilemma. It was all fine until grade 10 when I don't remember going on these thought trips. But now, the only thing that has changed in me in all these years is the degradation of my self perception.

I've read countless self help books, and tried to implement the teachings, but I guess life isn't the same for everyone, just because something worked for someone doesn't mean it will work for me too, or maybe I'm not even at a level that they would have any effect on my life. If only I could go back to the mental state where even if everything is going to shit, I don't spend half my day thinking about it.

The most disturbing part of all this is that I'm letting my parents down. People who have done their everything to get to where I am, never making me feel like I haven't been given enough. The only thing I have for them so far is gratitude, and I don't have any idea whether I'll be able to give them anything more. I'm not doing this for myself anymore. I'm only living for them in fact. Without them I'm no one, I have nothing but them, and I just wish I can return them a sliver of satisfaction, at least that's what they say they expect from me. All I want to do in life is to not be a failure in their eyes. But in two years, after bachelor's is over, the judgement day will be here. I'm scared and hopeless.

Have you ever felt remotely close to anything I've complained about here? If so, how did you cope with it? I don't know how much more this loneliness is supposed to last or if there's an end to it after all. I don't even think I'm going to have a family at this rate.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Below average at everything a human needs to have, feeling behind every single person my age given my privileges, failing to become a normal person, too much negativity in thoughts, lack of EQ, charisma, diligence and a peace of mind. Extreme fear of failure and living half dead. Nothing I've  tried has worked to make life better. Clueless, lost and frustrated.

&#x200B;

I'd appreciate very much if you'd take some time to maybe clear these clouds, I don't want to live a deluded life. I too want to be seen/ see myself as a normal person with a normal life. I don't want to be ""successful"", I want .... I don't know. I've spent a lot of time asking myself what I want but I can't put my finger around anything. At this rate, I don't expect to find meaning, purpose, person or happiness. Why did I turn out like this? Where did I go wrong?

11gqm3v,The end of Prachanda.,"Once upon a time, the most feared person of Nepal, many theories on how he looked like and what persona he had. But, when he came in media after the start of peace process, many must have been dumbstruck on how mediocre he was, his stature, and the disbelief that he was the top commander of the Maoist insurgents.

Nevertheless, he and his party came into mainstream politics and hesitant at first but eventually every other party scrapped their ideology and walked on the Prachanda path. The Maoists, meanwhile in the process of parliamentary politics and internal and external politics, have now been so divided that their existence is in question.

The Maoists simply cannot survive on its own and the leaders know this very well. Also, I'm amazed how the leaders of Congress and UML haven't realised that Prachanda is a cancer that's ought to be LASERED and removed. Sooner or later they will stop their friendly handshakes with the Maoists.

19c44bt,Late 20s and the quarter life crisis,"Please read it all if you can but if you don’t want to, there’s a tldr at the end. Also reach out if you’re feeling the same and want to talk.

I am in my late 20s now and I feel like I have a bit of quarter life crisis. There are a few different things and I felt like writing because others might relate as well.

Life has been good, God has been kind and I don’t have any reservations about it. I am fortunate to have so much and be in such a good place in life. I can’t ever be grateful enough for all the people and opportunities I have had. But again there’s a void, a feeling of emptiness at this time. 

There’s a feeling of being stuck in life where it doesn’t feel like it’s moving as rapidly as before. There’s no next thing that I need to do and everything is upto me. Whether I want another job or do this, that, it’s all upto me. Before there was always a thing you had to do: go to school, then go to college, then get a job and life moved so fast and in a guided path. Now, it’s like it slowed down a lot. I do know it’s moving but I’m not getting the same excitement anymore. Well obviously there’s a ‘next big thing’ that I need to do but there’s a conflict in there as well.

I’m single and not even actively looking for someone or putting an effort. It’s more because of the fear of making that big and final decision of life and not being sure about it. I do feel the need of that significant other in life to make it ‘complete’ but also don’t feel ready to make that commitment. 
But now I’m questioning if that other person would really fill that void? What if it’s me? There are a lot of videos these days around which say ohh happiness is within you, you need no one, blah blah and I think those are bullshit. I think being single and able to be happier than a good relationship is a myth. Humans need that other person. There are surveys that show married couples are happier, earn more, healthier than single people. So I do acknowledge that other person can bring a lot of happiness but I’m conflicted if that’s all that I need.

Loneliness is a part of life now; consuming me every now and then. So I talk to my friends a lot these days, almost daily and I feel that they want to talk as well maybe because of the same reason but we don’t really talk about it. I am so grateful to have them. They give me a sense of being connected, a sense of me not being alone out here.

Anyways that was my rant. I wanted to post here for some time and just did it. I’m a lurker here. Does anyone else have these feelings? I know a lot of people feel the same way about ‘marriage’ which also involves ‘finding that person’ for many people. I do feel these feelings are here only for some time, maybe until I turn 30 or I get married lol. Who knows?

Tldr: late 20s are weird times, you are kinda lost, feel stuck in life, don’t know what to do next or what your purpose in life is. Maybe the void is also because of not having a partner but would that fix all those feelings? Is that all that I need?

1ha2g2u,"Regarding public chat, and exploring other casual chitchat avenues.","Greetings all.

***TLDR: Until reddit live chat has more features to make your/our experience in it pleasant, it's be taken down until further notice. We're not looking to establish*** r/Nepal\-locker-room-talk***, we're here to be an inclusive, joyful lounge that anyone can join and holler at.***

You may have noticed in the past r/Nepal general chat was a thing. After thoughtful deliberation, we've decided to sunset our general chat - deleting it, simply put.

The reasons are the following:

* Lack of moderation tools

>Essentially, we had to rely on a ban-or-delete policy alongside verbal warnings, there was no ""soft-spot"" for us to conduct and collaborate, esp in PC(old/new reddit) UI. It was difficult to communicate the flow of a 3 strike warn -> ban -> appeal policy, especially for folks that really showed massive efforts in making someone else's day worse in the general chat. They were there for the kicks, and the shock value of saying something mean to somebody, and we had a really hard time curbing that behavior, especially those that were already entering the chatroom with ill intentions.

>Lack of features in ""cooling down"" members that were breaching community conduct policies was tricky for us. We request u/reddit look into muting people, giving them a second chance, instead of banning them outright immediately. After all, *we're all here to have a good time.*

* Rampant ""NSFW"" bot accounts/Presence of trolls

>Admittedly, we were slow with this. The issue was any time there was a very warranted report, we'd have to swap to our phones, because like aforementioned - PC UI has little to offer for us to quickly go through a queue/log. It made several of us spend hours just scrolling up trying to make sure everyone was having a good time and nobody felt bullied/left out, slighted, catcalled, or harassed. We tried out best with what we had, guys, it's just that it just wasn't keeping up with our zeal to make the chatrooms a success. We also found a vocal group of haters assimilating into the chat - inciting brigades and harassment on other subreddits. We denounce and condone their activities to the fullest. We're truly sorry for this, we tried to make it work.

1f4ru14,The full Nepali veda loop,"I think I might have just realized the full Nepali Veda circle. I’m studying for a bachelor's in Agriculture at a governmental college. The educational standard here is pure garbage. To pass a subject with good marks, all you have to do is memorize 80-90 pages of notes available at a stationery shop outside the university. Practicals? None. I would say only about 25-30% of the practicals mentioned in the syllabus are actually covered. And mind you, I’m talking about a bachelor's in Agriculture. The teachers don’t care about this stuff either—they have to cover 5 to 6 different colleges because MONEY!! This rant about how shitty the university is could go on for pages, but the point is, no student (at least 90%) is capable of landing a real job—a job based on real-world practical knowledge.

So, how does one ensure job security (or at least they think they do)? Networking. Haha. They get affiliated with political student unions, do what they’re told, participate in protests or rallies driven by others' vested personal interests, recruit juniors into the union, and repeat whatever their superiors feed them—all these dirty, pointless tasks. For what? Validation, false hope, security, and probably landing a job in the future.

These are the students who are supposed to bring reform to society, who are supposed to power the economy, replace the incapable ones, and take on leadership positions. But they keep their mouths shut out of fear that disagreeing—let alone expressing their own opinion—will get them alienated from the union, disliked by their superiors.

But who are these superiors I keep mentioning? The same old faces that keep getting involved in multimillion-dollar scams, that hold the power to change the constitution to their liking, that somehow get away with everything and return to the scene in no time, that have power over every authority—even the judiciary. And, in the end, they have every youth caught in the perfect loop.
  
Say this works for a few and from what ive seen it does actually work, No more than 2-3 from 500 and they get hired to work as a teacher, civil servant, leaders. Can you imagine what this process would have the person into? Same superiors i mentioned earlier who repeat the same cycle but now from a different position in the circle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1f4ru14/the_full_nepali_veda_loop/,8/30/2024 10:24,32,0,5,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

This song tells the story of being lost in the shadowy alleys of Kathmandu, where every corner feels like a threat in that time of the night. Fear sets in as the city’s maze-like streets grow darker, and it seems like there's no escape. Just as panic takes over, an ethereal, angelic girl appears out of nowhere, her presence both comforting and unsettling. She leads you away from danger, but there’s something almost ghostly about her, as if she exists between worlds.

After watching this i just recalled an incident happened with us which comes into my mind time to time.
So my village is in farwest nepal .
When I was 5/6 i with my sister and another girls and with brother (relatives) needed some red soil to do (LIPAI) like mopping mud house with red soil mixed with cow dunk and water including that red soil. Tala chana ma basthem tyo bela so , Ani chana teti ramrari Pani kasaile rakhsaina they hami haru so.
We went to upper jungles of our place there was a raute family. When we were done collecting soil we were going our way and saw them . At that time we didn't knew people with Central Asian facial features are present in our country (""farwest and it's tales"") we were already feared by their looks and rautes don't speak much good nepali cuz of their forest life.
And while we were going down, there father came with dirt on his face and with those facial features we were scared as fuck.
And then. The father asks her daughter what did you make for lunch,
and she replies: saamp banako.
We little kids didn't understood what she said. we were like fuckin holy cow these MF are eating snakes and they might kill us too let's just fkn go .
That time we started runnin and just Little by pass there was a men without one leg coming to us and our soul left our body (even we went to him to ask for help) us dumbass kids even being frightened already asked him for help don't know what he said we got even more sacred and ran for our life.
we were so sacred that we took 1/2 and just left our Boris (sack) and left with that fear.

I told her multiple times that her voice was inaudible, and that she isn't helping me, she got angered by that and kept repeating same the procedures but with a frustrated voice, while i was very calm and polite throughout the conversation.

1f1wywl,My recent back problem that occured due to my own negelect.,"The problem got solved, but let me tell you what happened to me recently.

For some weeks, my sleep was getting distrupted for some reason.

Slowly i could only sleep when i was exhausted and sleepy. 

Then suddenly my back and hip started to be in pain.

Then left leg. I had to turn again and again. And place a pillow between my legs to relief somewhat of my hip pain. But the back and leg pain had to be managed by turning side again and again.

It cuased me not be not able to sleep unless i was sleepy and my body auto shut down.

Next morning, my body would be in pain after i moved. The back and leg pain would be less, but if i remove pillow from my legs, hip pain would be another problem.

Soon i was tired, could not move much or else the pain was troubling.

Bendig to pick up things would cause sever pain. Even walking was getting affected.

When i googled, there was a probelm that seems to match my sympton. It said streching could relief pain so i did and it did help little.

Then i noticed a simple thing i had neglected to consider.

I sleep on dasna. Its old.

It seems to have moved inside and wasnt as flat as it should have been, some parts inside were forming peak and valley which was affecting my body.

I sems to have caused that when i was taking it out to clean my room, and since it is big and heavy, i had to fold it to move. But during one of those time, the inside were slowly moving and the problem inside it was formed.

So i decided to switch it with another old mattress. Not dasna but a proper matress. And boom, gone were the pain. 

After some days, the pain completly disappeared.

Previously sitting on chair and table that didnt allowly my body to be proerly allined had caused lower back problem. And now bed that wasnt flat caused another problem.


So be aware of how you are sleeping and where and how you sit. It can cause problem.

Previous with chair and table, it felt like i had some spine injury or soemthing. It was tok sever. When i stopped using those mismatched duo, it took almost 2 weeks for my body to recover.

If i had continued, i fear of permanent injury.

And it is easy to not take it seriously or neglect them. So be careful.

19f5tll,Excessive Daydreaming: The World Inside My Head,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share something that’s been a part of my life for as long as I can remember: excessive daydreaming. It’s a habit that brings a smile to my face when I’m alone, a world of fantasies and imagination where I’m the protagonist.

In this world, everything is good to me. I have everything that I want right now. It feels good, but I’ve come to realize that I’m doing this excessively. I believe that by engaging so much in my imagination, I’m not fully utilizing my abilities and focusing on the things that I’m aiming for.

For instance, when I’m in bed, or when I have a book, laptop, pen, and paper in front of me, I start imagining a beautiful world. It diverts my attention and reduces my urgency to study and put hard effort into it. I think I’m using this as an easy escape. I lack discipline. Even when I’m walking alone or traveling, I’m in a different world inside my head. It makes it easy for me to spend time alone without feeling lonely.  Sometimes, my friends catch me smiling while I’m lost in my thoughts, and I have a hard time explaining why.

This habit of engaging in excessive imagination sounds harmless, but it’s affecting my lifestyle. It’s a kind of lack of discipline.

Looking back at my childhood, I believe I developed this habit because I was expected to study all day. I used to fear and try to pretend studying, so nobody would say anything. I found a way to escape it by putting a book in front of me and living in my head. I didn’t make friends or socialize with my own age group, rather stayed alone and imagined.

I remember when everyone used to play cards during Dashain, my father asked me to go and study. I hated it. That day everyone is having fun and I have to study school books. I didn’t have anything apart from study books, so there was no option to read anything interesting.

I wonder if anyone else has a similar habit like mine. I’d love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have.

Thank you for reading so far.

&#x200B;

***TLDR***: *I’ve been excessively daydreaming for as long as I can remember. It’s a habit that I developed during my childhood as a means to escape from the pressures of studying. While it brings me joy and helps me spend time alone without feeling lonely, I’ve realized that it’s affecting my lifestyle and discipline. I’m curious to know if anyone else has a similar habit.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/19f5tll/excessive_daydreaming_the_world_inside_my_head/,1/25/2024 9:51,11,0,16,English,0,0,1,1,0,0
rub5td,The moderate caste based discrimination of Nowadays.,"I am a Bahun, janai and all. In our family, we do not discriminate people based on caste. Nope!! We discriminate based on how much money they have, and whether or not their son drinks alcohol.

As a kid, I was taught to treat everyone equally, as friends. I was taught to not discriminate my friends based on their skin color or their caste. But things changed two years ago. I am expected to find myself a fair-skinned, bahun girl, younger than me, who is ""Fit for me"". 

It was 2 years ago, when I told my mother about my then-girlfriend. She was very pretty, and had just completed BBA. I showed her Facebook profile to my mom, and she made an ugly face and said,""Newar riaxa....."". I was flabbergasted. Pailei vannu pardeina? Kati mehenat ley pattako kt thiyo yar. Laaaast ramri thi yar. We broke up for multiple reasons later on, my mom's remark being one of them.

Anyways, back to track. I talked to my other bahun friends later on. I didn't tell anyone else, in fear of being judged. But, turns out, people from other castes have to suffer this prejudice as well? 

A year ago, a friend of mine, and her boyfriend were thinking about getting married. The boy was a Bahun, and the girl was a Shrestha. They said their families were against them getting married, and the whole time I was thinking the boy's family was opposing them.

Turns out it was the opposite. The boy's father had married inter-caste with a Tamang (or Gurung. I don't remember). And had no qualms with a Shrestha girl being his daughter-in-law. But the girl's family was very very opposed to having a Bahun Son-in-law. They even threatened to kill both of them if they eloped. They are still dating, secretly from the girl's family.

So, Shahs don't marry anyone except Shahs. Chhetris don't marry anyone except Chhetris? How the fuck does it work?

Can someone explain how it works? Which of the castes do I have to avoid to not get threatened to death by my in-laws? 

So, I was shocked. Bahuns are not considered ""superior"" by everyone? Everyone thinks their caste is the ""superior""? What the fuck!! It is so fucking complicated that it is fucked up in so many levels. I thought only the bahuns were delusional. How can so many people be delusional at once?

1crjk19,Should we scrap 10 & +2 Board examinations ?,"Should the 10 and +2 Board exams be done away with ?  
The results of these don't matter. 10's boards is useless as top +2 institutes take entrance exams.   
12's boards results only matter as a barrier of entry for various bachelor programs. For eg for MBBS you have to take CEE entrance exam in exam where you have to have gotten 2.4 CGPA and minimum C in all subjects. This is such a low barrier that it doesn't even matter. And this also excludes students who couldn't achieve this because of many reasons maybe they were sick, or the teaching faculty was shit. So these board exams results don't matter. During Corona board exams were not conducted and it didn't matter much. 

1. So from result perspective , it doesn't matter.
2. From financial perspective , it must government something to conduct these exams. Although I couldn't find any data or news , if it isn't needed why waste the money. If you have some data please do share in the comments.
3. From the teaching perspective, there will be a shift from focusing on examinations to focusing on actually learning the contents of the subjects.
4. From the institute perspective, they will no longer be able to advertise +2 results. Thus their business of buying the exam centers and advertising will be over.

So overall , institutes will actually have to facilitate teachers to heartedly teach the students instead of teaching them just how to pass the exams all the while government saves some money.

These are my thoughts.   
What do you think ?  
Am I being narrow-minded and missing some perspective and angles ?  
Please do share your thoughts and criticisms .",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1crjk19/should_we_scrap_10_2_board_examinations/,5/14/2024 4:25,2,0,9,English,0,0,0,0,0,0
vmgw5h,"Stand against, I repeat, Stand against the tax cuts for petroleum products for general public by the government.","While I may get downvoted by saying this, the recent tax cuts by the government for petroleum products will do more harm than good.

I know the increase in petroleum products will increase the price of virtually everything including the household and construction sectors but look at Sri Lankans. Now, they can't buy petroleum even if they are willing to pay any amount which is caused due to depletion of foreign reserves and we are heading in the same direction. For people out of the loop, to import anything any country needs US dollars as it is the currency of international trade. The country earns dollars when it exports something. Normally these two sides of export and import should remain in balance for a country to be stable. In the case of Nepal, we earn the majority of USD by exporting youths to gulf countries and spend the majority of the dollars by importing fuel, vehicles, and other items. Anyway, as the price of fuel has almost doubled, the balance between import and export has fallen and we are importing much more than we can export. So, the foreign reserve is depleting every day. If the foreign reserve finishes, like in Srilanka, we cannot import anything. We won't be able to get any petrol even if we are willing to pay Rs 1000 a liter.

Decreasing taxes for individual use of petrol will encourage people to use petrol, even more, go on vacation or long tour or any recreational purpose.

The bottom line is that the tax cut should not be for general use petroleum rather it should be for diesel used by public or transportation vehicles or the fuel used by industries producing daily use goods. Protesting against the 20 rupees hike right now may cause you to buy petrol at a very very high rate on the black market, if you are lucky, later in the year. Be careful what you wish for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/vmgw5h/stand_against_i_repeat_stand_against_the_tax_cuts/,6/28/2022 7:00,114,0,30,English,1,0,0,0,0,2

ufbs1q,"Out of these four mayor candidates, who presented themself best ?","Just watched Dil Bhusan Pathak's Tough Talk with four Mayor candidates. 
Here is my analysis:

Two candidates were out of context, lacked depth or clarity or have any vision. 

Now let's come to the other two candidates. 

I heard Samikshya Baskota for the very first time. Though the visions and agendas seem alright and somewhat similar to Balen but lack the depth to answer.  She never answered the implementation phase and its impact. For example in the question about waste management she mentioned about separation of waste at the household level but what after that? 
In my personal view (Saying again just my personal view), she answered just based on what she saw during her stay in the USA but never explored how it's done beyond that point. She hasn't done her homework.

Now let's come to Balen, I think he was a clear winner out of four. He relevantly answered the question ( 80%) by providing some depths and dynamics to his answer. He somewhat discussed the solution to the problem based on factual data. Moreover, provide implementation at a high level. Negative about Balen, he is repetitive as in another interview (on a positive note it's consistency).

# The Dawn of Corporate Dominion (Fiction) : Nepal

In the 2100s, the world had shifted in ways no one could have predicted. China had risen to dominate the globe, both economically and politically, guiding the majority of nations into the embrace of communism. The once-powerful first-world nations, fearing the tides of change, voted to close their borders, creating self-contained societies where no one entered and no one left. The fate of these nations was now entirely in the hands of their own people, insulated from the outside world.

Amidst this global upheaval, a small nation in the heart of Asia stood apart—Nepal. In the year 2049, in a move that stunned the world, Nepal chose to cede its sovereignty not to a government, but to a corporation. The Asian Infrastructure Company, or AIC, a once-modest firm that had grown from building roads and bridges to mastering the very fabric of society through artificial intelligence, became the ruling power of Nepal.

The AIC didn’t just build physical structures; it created N.ai, a revolutionary software system that integrated every aspect of life, from governance to daily routines. What began as an infrastructure company became the backbone of a new society where technology dictated every move. N.ai was not just a tool; it was the invisible hand that steered the lives of millions.

1. Why are they building such high walls even in places where it seems like not needed.  In my area, the place is plain, and there's no need for the wall. But they build wall so tall, that whole place looks ugly. And some of the places, where walls are indeed needed. The walls are so high that it hides the whole block.
2. They are digging holes everywhere. Wouldn't it be better to finish at at least some of the places before destroying 100% of the places. Like there has been long ditch just 2 steps of the people's houses in Dhulikhel since months. Its still the same. And yet they are doing same in other places. How long would this mess last. Especially in rainy season, I fear for my children and other school going kids.
3. Currently, there are multiple places where riding is very bad experience, like above, why are they destroying things parallely? Road near Budol has been mess since months. Same in some other places.

My mom was always strict, urging me to protect myself and stand up against those who comes first. However, I never hadthe courage to raise a hand against others, and I couldn't understand why.

I am in agony. I comfort her and not worry all those stuffs that could made her feel good  
 

And the question raised in my mind is that ‘’What would I have done to him??’’ I mean ‘’if I was there, what could I have done?’’ he was with his other friends. It is clear that I would done nothing and this thing is hunting me down. I am really weak I don’t know why.

19czh9g,Unraveling the Trend of Nepali Youths Leaving for Foreign countries," 

I'm curious about the increasing trend of youths leaving our country. While factors like a lack of job opportunities play a role, one significant issue seems to be the prevailing inclination to leave Nepal. Many young individuals appear to be considering relocation not solely due to personal reasons, but rather influenced by the widespread trend of leaving the country.

When I inquire about my friends' plans after completing 12th grade, a recurring response is the intention to apply for opportunities abroad. It's not that I discourage the idea of going to a foreign country, but it's disheartening to observe that a substantial number of youths are deciding to leave Nepal simply because it's the prevailing trend.

It's crucial to make decisions based on personal aspirations and goals rather than succumbing to the influence of what everyone else is doing. While going abroad can be a fantastic opportunity, it's important to ensure that the decision aligns with one's individual dreams and ambitions rather than being solely driven by the current trend.

1c2u7ne,"Redefining Mission 84, a political essay"," Redefining Mission 84, a political essay

I had fully bought into the idea that 84 would be the inflection point for the country—that it would mark a change in the old ways of doing things. I believed that the country would be met with a new type of dynamism and fluidity that the country desperately needs. 

Dynamism and fluidity are not foreign concepts to Nepalis. The overthrowing of the Rana regime, the Jananadolan, the Maoist insurgency and the coup of the Monarchy were all moments of dynamic change. However, the dynamism fizzled and in the fizzling, we saw rigid systems that were designed by the formerly dynamic groups to extract wealth from the system. 

I’ve made this claim for a while now, but it has been echoed by Swarnim Wagle of RSP. The political system of Nepal has been such that it is a resting place for those of above average intellectual faculties and social adeptness. If someone has natural talent in leadership and a modicum of intelligence in Nepal, one is naturally gravitated to politics. Why? Because there were no options and still there are few options for said person to utilize their abilities for their own good and in consequent the good of the society. 

What else could you do if you were in this position, say if it was the early 2000s and you’re charismatic and possess a base level of faculties, that would ensure success if you were in a vibrant economy? You could study the sciences or mathematics only to be underpaid in jobs or be forced to move abroad, away from your family. Doesn’t sound appealing. You could take the civil service exam and become a bureaucrat, which many do, but there nearly aren’t enough jobs to accomodate everyone. The other option to get ahead would be business but business in a country that is reluctant to accept capitalism will seem difficult and almost unappealing. There was an almost feudalistic understand of business folks which limited doing business to certain ethnic groups. Whatever business was conducted was subsequently limited to trading, a way to make money from arbitrage and middleman-ery, ie. very little value creation. 

Politics becomes a way for these folks to get involved in. The extractive and corrupt nature of the running of the state has meant that it was a sure fire bet, given you have the abilities that are selected in this field. The result of this system has been that there is very little competition in politics. This is paradoxical at first for one would assume all these people vying for power would lead to competition, but the legacy parties and the state has been constructed in such a way that the system is rigid and top down. 

One gets a position of power, or “pad”, by being loyal to their party and waiting their turn. “Palo kurne”, and “paicho tirne” politics is common practice in Nepal. Because the seats at the top are rigid—which if I were to hazard a guess as to why, it is because those are the top are most skilled at keeping the order that allows for them to extract and any change in leadership means potentially jeopardizing the party machinery to extract. So these talented folks, which I grant that they are talented, in the nebulous definition of that word, are stuck as mid level politicians and party cadres. Because it pays the bills. 

Swornim Wagle echoed this sentiment by saying that federalism and the bloated construction of the provincies is a means for, “ purana party ka middle level ko karyakatra haru lai bewasthapan ka lagi matra laieko. Josle 30 barsa rajniti ma bitaisakyo ra usle kaile sangiya samsad dekha pako xaina, testa lai bewasthapan garne prabidhi jasto bhayo,”. I am citing Wagle here because I’ve heard him say it but this is not a new observation and I’m sure other people have made similar claims. 

[https://youtu.be/um1kqERUk-I?t=6349](https://youtu.be/um1kqERUk-I?t=6349)

This idea can be reinforced by the way the parties, namely the three dals handle their candidate selection. Party tickets are given by those at the top to those at the lower rungs of the ladder and the criteria is ambiguous. We can opine was to what goes on under this veil of mystery but there are different narratives behind each candidate’s receiving of their ticket. That is all to say, it’s never popularity or electability alone. 

This idea does not extend to only people who are politicians, though. We see this kind of loyalty in giving tenders for construction projects as well as getting things done at government offices. Those with political connection get the tenders which in turn relates to wealth generation. People get their work done quicker at CDO offices and malpots if the sachib is of their party. This kind of extractive politics has extended and permeated through many parts of Nepali life. 

This system is rigid in that too many smart and capable people have invested too much of their life into politics that they cannot let go without receiving something in return. These middle level karyakartas wait expectantly, hushing up while those in their party engage in corruption, or even going as far as to engage in the extractive nature of the system themselves. This is not only present intra-party but also inter-party. We’ve heard the phrase, “they protect themselves”. It makes sense to protect within the party but because all three parties are so dependent on the existence and continuation of the system, that they go far as to protect the other parties so as to not jeopardize their means of creating wealth for themselves. 

This leads to why I believed in mission 84. In my naïveté, I believed that a new party, be it RSP or others, would come and disrupt the “3-dal hegemony”. That a new party would not have that rigidness in their system to extract, nor would they have the experience to extract. So in this vacuums of skill and expertise in engaging in corruption and getting away with it, which is that the “3-dals” are good at presently, they would need to be smart in the act of statecraft and governing. 

It was a kind of accelerationist view that I held, that it all needs to crumble, but not in a revolutionary way where too much work done by the previous generation, good or bad, would be tossed by the wayside. Mission 84, the way it was and is presented by RSP was my hope clinging onto this happening. 

RSP have yet to prove themselves able in being the party that can be incorruptible and innocent. They have their own ghosts from the past. See Rabi Lamichhane. But my hopes do not lie with RSP alone. That’s the change in mindset I’ve had recently. 

I do think 84 needs to be an inflection point. We cannot let the extractive state continue any further for there are demographic pressures that cement the need for development as soon as possible—if we wait any longer, as we have been forced to do under the “3-dal” hegemony, the working population will be too old and spread too thin to make significant progress. 

Therefore, I present a new understanding of mission 84. Let RSP battle it out. Let’s judge them critically and hold them to a higher standard than our parents have held the “3-dal”, but let’s also demand more from the “3-dal” themselves. KMC’s mayoral election was an example of the complacency displayed by the old parties. It stemmed from a disrespect they had for the electorate. They ran some poor candidates in Srijana Singh and Keshav Staphit. However, UML wisened in selecting Dangol into their ticket. 

This kind of wisening in picking new faces that have not toiled away their life in the party machinery is exactly what we need to see in 84. These candidates the old parties select need not only be fresh faces but they also need to provide assurance that they will not commit the same sins folks in the upper rungs of their party have committed. We can only speculate as to how influenced by the UML machine Dangol is but it would be a safe bet to say not as much as Keshav Staphit would have been. 

Mission 84 needs to be a political makeover for the country and this needs to come not only from RSP but from an overturning of the “3-dal” hegemony. But that’s not enough, we need to see another RSP phenomena where a charismatic leader like Rabi, albeit with fewer ghosts from the past, form new parties to challenge constituencies and the samanupatik vote. 

The system that needs to be created post mission 84 is one of dynamism. Nepal needs to get rid of masu bhat politics, paicho tirne politics and kurera bas politics. These are mechanisms the old guards have used to continue their extractive regime. I don’t care who you vote for. I personally am a fan of intellectuals like Wagle and Sumana Shrestha. I do care that you do not throw your vote in 84. The onus is on all of us to make change and we do that by being wiser than the past in selecting the candidates that will represent us and shape the future. Having 10 Sumana Shrestha will be monumental in shaping the policy environment of the future. We need more Balens, not afraid to speak up against the old guard, even if it means breaking some rules and doing so distastefully. 

I believe post 84, we need to see a “move fast and break things” system. Let the inexperienced in power, for in their inexperience they also do not know how to be corrupt and to hide their corruption. Let the new ideas emerge even if it makes us uncomfortable for in our confort and complacency, we’ve only managed to ship laborers to the gulf. Let politicians make mistakes if they are new and novel mistakes. If they repeat the same old mistakes of using their political power to grand tenders to their party members, that is unacceptable. But if a Sumana Shrestha-esque politician makes a policy call that ends up backfiring, we live and learn. 

If you don’t believe in this understanding of Mission 84, I can only assume you’re pessimistic and cynical about the country’s future, in which case, your opinions need not be given consideration. Or you are so intwined in the old guard and their machinery that you fear losing your place in the world if the system changes. The only way we discover vibrancy in the political system is through exploration of new ideas. We must thank the old guard for getting us to this point for UML, Congress, the Maoists, and the other smaller parties have toiled to get rid of the system that did not work. The mission 84 folks need to do the same but with less revolutionary zeal and instead an interest to reform.

17tfr0v,Balding and greying,"Today I was doing the Tihar special ghar dailo sar safai abhiyan and I noticed something right away. Every stoke of the broom accumulated more and more hair, every room I went to clean, I'd come out of it with enough hair to make a wig out of it. It was to a point that the amount of hair was noticeably more than the actual dust I was attempting to clean. It had been a while since I had done a thorough cleaning but I have been brooming my rooms almost every 2/3 days. I got scared seeing at how much my hair had fallen within such a short time.

My hair was never thick to begin with, but that is why it is a much bigger problem, how thin will it get?? At this rate of hairfall, I wouldn't have a single strand left by the time I'm 25 (I'm 21 now). Problem here is that my hair fall looks on track to exceed the rate at which my father and grandfather's hair did. We do share some form of androgenic alopecia but I think it is getting more pronounced with me.

 The hairline towards my temples are receding rapidly. I am coping with this by outgrowing the hair on the top of my head and fizzling it around so that these areas are covered but this trick won't hold up for too long either with the rate it is going. I tried to consult with doctors but they suggested that it was genetic and I should regularly use medicine if I want to prevent it. But having to be dependent on medicine for my whole youth seems counterproductive at least.

If someday I am at risk of going completely bald, I am thinking of getting a hair transplant surgery then. Have any of you had any experience with such procedures? And has medication like Finasteride and Minoxidil worked for any of you that have tried? I'm trying to find the most efficient way out of this dilemma.

In addition, the hair on the side of my head is slowly turning white at such a young age. In just a couple of months, it has become uncountable how many grey hairs I have at this point. I use shampoo once every 2/3 days to try to combat these, but I don't think there has been any substantial improvement anyway.

How important is hair for finding a balanced partner for life? In case I do get bald by the time I have to marry, will my hair impact my potential soulmate pool? Or would it be a good thing because I would get to marry someone who doesn't judge me based on something I can't control?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/17tfr0v/balding_and_greying/,11/12/2023 8:12,5,0,12,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,0,1,0,1,2
12y4qop,Why didn't the flight take an emergency landing and continued to its destination?,I am not an expert here and the pilots probably knew it better but wouldn't taking an emergency landing back to TIA be the smartest option here.

And these measures are kept so that they can land safely at the nearest airport as soon as possible.

18bz8b9,Nepal and its problem with corruption,"I keep hearing Nepal is not developed due to corruption but that doesn't make sense so i asked chat gpt about it. 
""If corruption exist on both developed and developing countries, what is holding developing countries back""

and here is the answer. I think it is valid. What do you guys think about it!


> Corruption can indeed exist in both developed and developing countries, and it manifests in various forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, and abuse of power. However, the impact of corruption on developing countries is often more pronounced, and several factors contribute to this situation:

1. **Institutional Weakness:**
   - Developing countries may have weaker institutions, including law enforcement, judiciary, and regulatory bodies. This makes it easier for corruption to go unchecked and for those engaging in corrupt practices to evade accountability.

2. **Lack of Accountability:**
   - In some developing countries, there may be a lack of effective mechanisms for holding public officials accountable for their actions. Weak checks and balances contribute to an environment where corruption can flourish without consequences.

3. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Limited resources can impede the ability of developing countries to invest in robust anti-corruption measures, such as effective law enforcement, transparent governance structures, and comprehensive regulatory frameworks.

4. **Poverty and Inequality:**
   - Poverty and inequality can exacerbate corruption. In societies with high levels of poverty, individuals may be more susceptible to corruption, and public officials may be tempted to engage in corrupt practices due to financial pressures or unequal distribution of resources.

5. **Political Instability:**
   - Political instability or weak governance structures can create an environment conducive to corruption. Frequent changes in leadership and inadequate governance can hinder the implementation of consistent and effective anti-corruption policies.

6. **Lack of Education and Awareness:**
   - Insufficient education and awareness about the detrimental effects of corruption may contribute to its persistence. Citizens may be less likely to demand accountability or actively participate in anti-corruption efforts without a clear understanding of the consequences.

7. **Cultural and Social Factors:**
   - Cultural and social norms can sometimes tolerate or even encourage corrupt practices. Breaking away from ingrained cultural norms that may facilitate corruption can be challenging.

8. **Global Economic Factors:**
   - Some developing countries may face challenges related to their integration into the global economy, including issues like unfair trade practices, debt burdens, and unequal international relations, which can contribute to corruption.

9. **Transparency and Reporting:**
   - Developing countries may lack transparent reporting mechanisms and whistleblower protection, making it difficult for individuals to report corruption without fear of retaliation.

10. **International Factors:**
    - International factors, such as global economic systems, trade practices, and geopolitical dynamics, can sometimes contribute to corruption in developing countries. Unequal power dynamics in global relations may exacerbate corruption-related challenges.

Addressing corruption in developing countries requires a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening institutions, promoting transparency, fostering economic development, and addressing social and cultural factors. International cooperation and support can also play a significant role in helping developing countries combat corruption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18bz8b9/nepal_and_its_problem_with_corruption/,12/6/2023 8:05,0,0,11,English,0,0,0,0,0,0

1crjzlu,Is getting yelled at for crying just a part of our Nepali culture? I’m taking about my particular situation.,"I 21(f) have been living in Australia for 11  years now.
I’ve studied in Nepal till grade 5. 
I occasionally visit Nepal for a holiday like once every two years. 
 But asti my Sanima (one from Canada and one from US) came to Australia to visit me.
And my grandmother and cousin came from Nepal for a holiday as well to visit.

I also have a 12 year old brother who has extreme behavioural issue.
Like Risako Bela ma j pani boldinxa .
He causes a lot of unnecessary conflicts in the house.

He did the same to my Sanimaas and cousin 
Like saying the f words and stuff
Disrespecting them out of anger 
And simply being a pain. 

So I cried a lot out of embarrassment 
I didn’t know how to handle my brother. 
Hajurama was like “Na rou, bhai lai saancho chaina”
Hajurama begged me not to cry
I stopped 
Ani feri My brother caused some shit while I was going shopping 
I cried again
Dad came from work
My kaachi sanima hugged me 
Paxi my maili Sanimaa cried as well

Which made me feel really sad 
Pachi Hajurama yelled at me for crying she was like “Na roh vanya haina!! Taile garda bhako ho etc. tero didi (my cousin) le aafno fupu ko Chora chori sanga deal garnu parxa taile Jabo bhai le garda Runey” etc
I felt so bad even baba was like 
“baru runai maan Lagey bathroom ma gayera runu, timi roko dekhera Timro maili Sanima lai ni bore lagdaina”
Like my grandmother litteraly said it was my fault because I was being “Kamjor/weak for crying” and “Pauna aako cha talai vanera ooata Canada/US Nepal dekhi, ani yo awastha ma uni haru aba aauchan talai vetna?”
Like bruhhh??? I’m at fault now for simply expressing my emotions due to feeling overwhelmed?? 
Bhai caused a lot of trouble I was embrassed ani ma roye 
Even my cousin who grew up in Nepal was like
“Runu hudaina, control garna parcha, strong hunu parxa”
Like growing up in my family I was known as the runchi
When I visited my therapist she used to say that crying is healthy and a good way to express your emotions 
But my cousin doesn’t seem to agree with it
But now I have a question 
Is it just a part of our Nepali culture to get yelled at for crying??
Or am I overreacting??
I was mostly hurt by hajurama saying that it was my fault that my maili Sanima cried
When my brother was the one causing all this and everyone saw that
My hajurama has the mentality that crying makes you weak
Like bachha bela pani hajurama le gali garda I cried tra when I cried she just yelled.
Don’t get me wrong
I’m not here to demonise my family 
They’re wonderful people with flaws 
Sabai jana dherai Barsha paxi aauda ramailo vayo 
But I was just worried about that particular situation 
Like why was I blamed for simply crying??
I especially felt worst watching my Maili Sanima cry for the first time in my life
Even as a kid I never saw her cry before
My brother is the type of kid that’s difficult to deal with
Pitey ni sudridaina any

14 years ago, a rather forward thinker senior(14?15? year old) in my school created a fuss. She had outgrown her skirt slightly. Her skirt had reached her knee instead of below the knee which was the school protocol. The horror. She created a ruckus, aligned several other female students to her cause. Causing the physically abusive vice principle to go ""skirt kholera nangai ghumaidinxu"" to the senior. Following that exchanging which also included sl\*t shaming and physical violence, she became recluse of herself. Physically present but mentally and emotionally absent. She probably also had a nervous breakdown. 

Today I met a 12 year old. She had anger management issues and absolute hatred for adult males. She also refused to go to school. Any school. Come to find out from her father, some teacher threatened with the same. ""Nangai parera, assembly agadi rakhdinxu"" I don't know what lead upto it or what caused it or what else was done to her. But after ""Me too"" that people keep cursing, after so much awareness that reached everyone with a phone, etc etc. A decade plus on, and our teachers, and education system is still stuck on that same rut. Our girls are going to be facing the same thing that we faced a decade or so back. Nothing has improved.

yu2em8,What's the good age to get married ??,"It's been 7 years to my relationship. I won't say it was best years with her, rather it was a roller coaster. Anyway I love her and always dreamed to be with her. Our parents knew about us lately and they're planning for marriage ,not more than 1 year from now. I'm **22** now, currently studying computer science and working as a application developer (30 to 50k per month), but the thing is i don't feel like i'm grown up and ready for marriage.

I can't even postpone the marriage because everybody started the planning thinking that we might not get chance to get married due to death of our *santan.* My family is balanced I mean I'm sure I won't have to struggle financially.  They're very supportive. It's just me who's really confused right now.  It's not that i don't want her, I just feel like i'm not mature enough to handle her anger, responsibilities and all. Guys please care to give some suggestions.

htv7ho,My pro-India rant as a Nepali living in India for the past 8 years,"TL;DR:

* Oli is the collective Nepali alter-ego; we are as dumb as our politicians
* India loves Nepal to bits, despite the Nepali media and other forces spewing claiming otherwise
* India is our only true ally; India gives equal rights and privileges to Nepalese working in India
* The list of Nepali people who achieved international success in India despite being Nepali proves that
* China is not our trump card. China has no emotional attachment with Nepal. We should stop threatening India with our China card.
* We should wake up and smell the coffee. It's in our favor to side with India for realpolitik/geo-political reasons. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As a Pravasi Nepali, it pains me to watch the bitterness brewing between the people of Nepal and India in recent times.

While I believe most of the misunderstandings between the two countries are the result of petty politics on both sides, I think Oli’s abysmal short-sightedness is the biggest culprit that’s creating  deeper rifts between the two nations.

This guy is so dumb I personally don’t believe he’s worthy of being a Chinese pawn or someone who deliberately makes divisive statements because he wants to emulate Trump.

He’s just dumb—there’s nothing better at play here. He lacks the filter that people have between their heads and their mouths.

But as much as I hate Oli ba for being this real-life edgelord that he is, I think he pretty much personifies the Nepali zeitgeist right now. We may not realise it, but Oli is our collective alter ego like Tyler Durden was to Edward Norton’s character in the *Fight Club*.

And that’s going to be my rant in this post.

We Nepali people can’t appreciate good things in life. We let our insecurities and ego override our emotions and actions. We also have this special power to make bad things worse.

India and Nepal are historically, culturally, and geopolitically one and the same.

But leave that touchy-feely connection aside for a moment and let’s look at it from the angle of realpolitik.

We are surrounded by India from three sides.

India is our ONLY ally in the whole world.

We suck on India’s tits like parasites.

And most of all—I think India cares for us. They accept us as one of their own—in a good way, not in the aggressive, expansionist way of thinking.

I know that’s a controversial statement that’s hard to digest for most Nepali people. But if you aggregate the love-hate relationship between India and Nepal, I think the brotherly love will outweigh other emotions hands down.

I know this because I am living in India for the past eight years and my experience has been nothing short of absolute pleasure.

I came to India in 2013 after marrying an Indian girl (she’s a Nepali by ethnicity). Before coming here, I was studying in the US where I dealt with a number of issues.

Trust me, coming to India was the last thing I had in mind while enjoying the perks of the American soil. Had it not been for this girl, who I had briefly studied together with in a college in Nepal, I’d perhaps have never even come to India.

I was ridiculed by everyone around me in Nepal and the US when I announced my decision to go to India to be with her. Of course, Nepal was my first choice when I decided to leave the US.

But the range of bad experiences that I had from the moment I landed in TIA till the next two weeks I spent in Nepal, my patriotic dreams of doing something in my motherland went up in smithereens.

So naturally, my bae suggested I try my luck in India—which I eventually did.

And I am very thankful for everything India has given to me and my family.

I am so immersed with my life in India that I want to spend the rest of my life here because there’s nowhere else in the world where I can create a better financially, spiritually, and culturally balanced lifestyle.

But it’s not just me who feels this way though. During the last eight years of my stay in India, I have crossed paths with scores of fellow Nepalese who share similar sentiments.

And I’m not talking about Nepali people from Northeast India.

I’m talking about the several Nepali daju-bhai hailing from Pyuthan, Diktel, or Doti who worked as servers in Indian restaurants in cities as far as Coimbatore.

I’m talking about the Nepali didi from Jhapa who was manning a hotel’s front desk in Dwarika when I took my mom for a pilgrimage there.

Of course, I have met countless *dai*s from all parts of Nepal working as dutiful watchmen and security guards in apartment buildings and corporate offices for several years.

I have met second-generation Newari families originally from Kathmandu who have started a travel and tourism business and have no plans to return to Nepal.

I’m also talking about the Nepali guy from Nawalparasi who runs a successful podcast and has co-founded a company with his Indian friend.

I have met several dozen other Nepalese who own and run legitimate businesses in several parts of India enjoying the same rights that India citizens enjoy.

Like me, many of them have started a family here, drive a car, have a steady stream of income, and go about their lives just like an Indian citizen.

During my interactions with the above mentioned fellow countrymen, there are a few things that stand out.

At some point in our lives, we all held some level of resentment or reservations about India before coming here.

It’s mostly because of the underlying anti-Indian sentiment that the Nepali media spews on us while we are in Nepal. It’s also because we judge India and its people through the lens of our limited interactions with our closest neighbors in the south—Bihar and UP.

I’m not shitting on these two states, but there’s no denying the fact that most Nepali people either travelling through these states or living in bordering areas next to these states have had some bad experiences with our southern neighbors.

Even the police in these states act like goons and loot Nepali migrant workers to the barebones out of all their hard-earned money while the latter are travelling back to Nepal.

But the experience is relatively better bordering states like Uttarakhand or even West Bengal. And it’s definitely way, way better in other, deeper parts of India.

Nepali people get more respect and are happier working in India than other popular destinations like the Middle East or Malaysia.

The money might be lesser in India, but the prospects are better than rotting as a hillbilly in our own country or dying out of exploitation at the hands of the ruthless masters in Dubai.

All this to say, India is a blessing for a country like Nepal.

But our problem is—we get triggered at the drop of the hat.

Some dimwit in Chitwan gets bored and makes up a tabloid story about Hrithik Roshan saying something stupid about Nepal and we jump at each other’s throat without verifying the facts.

We burned cinema halls owned by Nepalis, beat our brothers from terai, and caused 11 people to die in riots caused by a cheap Rs. 2 evening tabloid.

This has been repeated enough times in the past that now we can draw an embarrassing pattern across it.

My dad used to tell me how his generation cancelled the showing of Sholay in Nepali theatres because of some off-hand remark that Dharmendra made about Nepal at that time.

Same thing happened in the 1990s when Madhuri Dixit mistakenly assumed that Nepal was part of India. IIRC, she apologised, like Hrithik did (for a crime he didn’t commit).

I also remember the time when people in my town came out and burned posters and CDs of the movie *Gharwali Baharwali* because the totally-fictional movie plot had a minute-long clip of Raveena Tandon telling a bunch of Nepali people (actors) to GTFO of her home.

Most people in Nepal think India and its people look down on Nepal and its people. The reality is, Indians love Nepali people to bits.

Let me draw from the spring well of my rich personal experience to back this up.

Anyone who knows about being a Nepali student in the US would know that we have to find illegal jobs at gas stations and grocery stores to support ourselves financially.

I too had the privilege of going through that experience during my five years of stay in the US. And thanks to the widespread presence of Indian business community there, I never had a problem finding a 9-hour-a-day hustle in a gas station despite living in three different regions in the US—the upstate, middle west, and California.

Except one or two exceptions, my Indian bosses always treated me and my Nepali friends with respect and care. I worked for Punjabi, Gujarati, and South Indian bosses and I secretly believed that Indians preferred hiring Nepalese in the US more than the Indians from outside their community. (I could be totally wrong here; it’s just my hypothesis.)

One of the Punjabi owners I worked for even paid my wages three months in advance for me to pay my out-of-pocket college fees. That right there is a rarity. He was the coolest mad-lad I ever worked with—he smoked weed with us, let us crash in his house sometimes, and helped us with a lot of things—despite being busy and filthy rich by our standards.

On the other hand, my experiences working with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis were not so great. Heck, my experiences living and working with fellow Nepali people are actually pretty worse. (e.g., कोहि कोहिनेपाली ब्रो हरु आफुलाई धेरै घण्टा चाहिएको बेलामा Store को साहूलाई चिप्लो घसेर अरु नेपाली लाई side लाई दिन्थे, which was very uncool.)

And the same thing is true for Nepalese living and working in India.

The number of issues that I mentioned earlier about my life in the US range from random Americans eyeballing me while I manned the cash register, calling me racially-provocative names, or telling me (and others like me) to go back where I came from.

In the last eight years of my life in India, not one Indian has discriminated against me based on my Nepali identity—despite the fact I proudly wear my Nepali identity on my sleeve.

I have changed multiple jobs without being asked any difficult questions. I have made several lifelong friends who are no different than my friends back home.

And I have noticed that most Indian people actually soften their stance once they discover I have come to India to live and work all the way from Nepal.

They immediately strike a conversation with me about their visit to Pokhara, Pashupatinath, or Muktinath, or something that makes me happy to talk about my motherland.

But let’s come back to the Nepal-India geopolitics.

Yes, the number of Nepalese going to India for work might not represent the biggest slice in our remittance pie chart.

Yes, there’s bullying on the border and most of our politics has been historically run by Indian diplomats in New Delhi.

There are several other things that’s wrong between India-Nepal relationship. To be honest, these are natural power dynamics that occur when a puny nation neighbors a regional hegemony state.

But because it’s in Nepal’s best interests, I think Nepal should stop whining about it and employ smarter diplomacy to persuade India for our own advantage.

Think of all the goodness that has come out of our proximity with India.

You all know about Manisha Koirala, Jitu Rai (now an Indian citizen), Vishnu Shrestha, Binod Homagai, Balkrishna Acharya, Sister Nirmala, and a long list of other Nepalese who gained widespread success and recognition in their respective fields despite not being Indians.

Do you think these people would have achieved the same level of success had they kept struggling in Nepal? I doubt it.

And what other country’s citizens can boast of having access to these privileges in India like Nepalese do?

Perhaps Bhutan can stake similar claims. But again, I don’t know of any Bhutanese who come to India to support their livelihood or crush their life goals.

On the other hand, Indian soldiers arrest Sri Lankans (and vice versa) for illegally crossing the border. Until very recently, they had shoot-at-sight orders for Bangladeshis who sneaked through the barbed wire to enjoy a better quality of life in India.

Nepal is to India what Mexico is to the US—so far from god, so close to India.

The point is—Nepal should explore opportunities to improve our ties with India rather than trying to make things worse. We should mend our fences instead of vandalising them.

One of my professors in Nepal used to say that Nepal is a country that begs on a golden plate. (Metaphorically saying, we don’t know the golden opportunities we have in our hands.)

He said that even if we could forget about the rest of the world and just focus on attracting the right kind of business—like tourists and pilgrims—from the world’s two biggest economies China and India, we would hit a jackpot!

And I believe that observation holds very true. I’m stating the obvious here but I think what’s lacking in Nepal is visionary political leadership that can maneuver Nepal’s diplomacy with India (and China) where we stand to gain everything while losing very little.

But who am I kidding? We are Tyler from Fight Club.

Like Bhupi Sherchan famously said about the Nepali bravado—हामी वीर छौँ तेसैले त हामि बेवकूफ छौं .

Our hair-trigger anger is what kills our rational thinking. We have 8 out of the world’s 10 tallest mountains, but our ego is 2X bigger than all of those peaks combined.

Launching meme wars to make fun of Indian media is one thing, but buying into the fake Pakistani narrative of Hindutva extremism, Indian expansionism is plain stupid.

Most of you who make anti-Indian posts on reddit and India do so from your three-story ivory towers in Kathmandu.

When you call Indians *dhotis* and *Bhakts* to polarise them further, you don’t realize the direct impact it might have on the naive Nepali diaspora here.

Or the series of events these things might lead to one day that will leave Nepal scrambling for food scraps.

You fancy sealing the Indo-Nepal border as a solution to our many problems, but you can’t imagine the economic and social evil that will unleash on Nepal if that actually happens.

You might realize how lucky we are to have India as our next door neighbor when you have to accompany a sickly or dying relative to Medanta hospital in Delhi or CMC in Vellore.

Thankfully, the Indian society is more tolerant compared to us and there have been no untoward reaction from their side so far.

For all the years that I have heard and felt the rise of anti-Indian sentiment in Nepal, I’ve not yet met an Indian who is anti-Nepal.

Indians are our brothers and sisters who trust us with their lives. Nepali soldiers have died in Kargil and Kashmir fighting to protect India’s sovereignty and safeguarding the precious lives of Indians.

I’m sure India would do the same if shit comes down to it.

We should foster the same level of trust and brotherhood between the two countries in our day to day interactions.

Fuck our overly sentimental machismo.

Long live 🇳🇵🇮🇳friendship!

1bd28is,Domestic violence in neighborhood,"So, a couple months ago, I heard my neighbor argue with his wife at night. They live in a shed, y'know the houses made with tins usually used for roofing. So when he fought with her, he'd bang on the walls and the sound would echo through the neighborhood. I just brushed it off thinking just a small fight cuz sometimes people have arguments.

Since about a week, I have been hearing these fights more often. And I noticed it's always one-sided. The man gets drunk and swears at his wife, bangs the walls, breaks things. Today he broke a tv in front of their house. Moreover, he started breaking a lot of stuff. Then I even heard someone cry. I think it was the wife. What I had been ignoring seems wrong to do. I wanted to call the police. But I feel like I should discuss it with the wife first.

Earlier, I tried to call out anyone present there, cuz they had their doors closed. I don't know them at all tbh. But as I waited for a chance for the man to calm down his anger(he had been shouting all that time), he kept telling her ""You wanna call the police, go ahead, they can't do shit to me"" and stuff like that. From what I heard, they're a family of 3, they have a son. I feel like she's not calling the police because she's afraid of her husband getting arrested. I just hoped she would.

I wanted to interfere the fight but my room is very close to their place so I'm afraid the drunk dude might try causing us harm as well. I live with my younger brother so a grown ass man would possess danger to us so I want to be safe as well.

That's why I'm just in a dilemma. Should I just call the police? Or should I get to talk to her first as to know the whole situation and get her to do it herself?

18dowsc,Just Letting it All Out!,"I know nobody is perfect, nobody can ever be. So all my life I've been brought up in a traumatic environment. Never have I ever been in a space where I can be at peace. There's always something going on. I hate to say it but my father doesn't exist to me even if he's still alive. Don't come at me telling me that he's the one who gave you birth and brought you up... 
I have never once seen a smile in my moms face when I was a child, he used to beat her up and all we could do was cry our eyes out and go to sleep. 
Fast forward to now, nothing has changed. I cried my eyes out on my moms lap saying I don't want to live no more( not very long ago). This mental torture has been so much that I can't bear anymore. I don't enjoy family functions anymore, because there is always one thing that keeps on running in my head "" feri khayera k babaal machyaune ho"". So, I decided to not go to any family functions when he is there. It's not that I'm depressed or anything but I enjoy staying alone and my work keeps me occupied. 
I have to live with it for the rest of my life and sometimes I don't like the person I have become. I have surpreseed the feelings long enough that sometimes it comes out with wrong bursts of anger.

18hoizs,When did I become this worthless?,"This rant has been a few days in the making to be honest. A whole rollercoaster of thoughts and self speculation. Some points I added, some I removed as the days went by. So it's safe to say this one is going to be a long read.

As with all my past rants, I will include a tl;dr at the end for someone who wants to read only a single line of self loathing. This one will possibly be extremely long.

I wanted to pinpoint a time where my life took a turn for the worse, and after tons of questions over the course of possibly months of self doubt, hatred and soul searching, I came to a divisive answer; maybe it all began with my birth? (*Cliché, I know*) What led me to this verdict? In the end it was probably just intuition, but maybe delving into retrospect with the following thoughts has made a prominent impact on my thought process.

Twenty one years. So far I am the culmination of events that have unfolded in the past two decades and some. That is twenty one years of... emptiness? I can't remember when was the last time I felt full, when was the last time I felt... human. Before I started to dive headfirst into existential crisis at each of my steps, it was like I didn't have a consciousness at all. When I hear people say ""When I was a kid I thought..."", I stare in awe and repeat ""you... THOUGHT??"". I don't remember ever thinking as a child. I don't much remember my growing days, maybe because nothing remarkable did really happen. No extremely fun inducing event, nor a struggle to be remembered for ages. It was plain boring. I don't even remember people I met until I was what 10 years old? Could it be that my memory did a hard reset and I just can't comprehend anything beyond a certain point in the past? But I do remember some very vague details about the imagery I was brought up in, because it was the same thing almost every day.

I'm not from the valley and so where I grew up, there wasn't too much urbanization so to speak. I'd sneak out my house and go to my cousins sometimes. That is something I have an illusion of remembering, maybe since my parents keep bringing it up while talking about my childhood. Most other stuff they talk about, I can't even put two plus two and imagine the scenarios. I spent my childhood locked up because I was the only child up until age 5 and I'd stay at home the whole day watching cartoons. I don't remember ever interacting with anyone other than my parents, at least I don't have the memory of it. Sure there was struggle in the family, parents running errands and making ends meet while keeping me sheltered from it all. But that came with its own set of cons, now I had become a shell of a person.

As a kid, you learn to differentiate wrong from right but for me, every decision was already made, I was merely flowing. I guess that is not how people learn. I've never been a sharp or cunning person but by the time my age-peers were playing marbles and practicing economy though it, I was still unsure whether I should or not take my pants off in front of adults. As far as I can tell, and have been told, I don't have any mental infirmity that should limit my potential the way it has shown itself, and now looking at that in retrospect, maybe something is wrong with my underlying psyche. But I'm alright now, or so I'd like to assume, to cope with this overwhelming feeling of inadequacy. It was clear I couldn't tell left from right, couldn't choose from a trouser and a short, while surprisingly being decent in academics, with a consistent enough first ranking all throughout my developing years.

I have been looking at people doing things that they do and possibly try to learn from it, but I find the results in the form of nothing but disappointment. I can't even learn the way others do. If I can't think like a human, talk like a human, learn like a human or even feel like a human, there can only be one possible explanation. It lies in a question of **Am I even a human or just a failed replica?** Am I really the result of millions of years of evolution or have I just popped up with no evidence to show for the development that is supposed to have happened.

*""Talk like a human, you say?""* I have an incredibly slow response time and by the time I think of a reply to a sentence, the context will have already changed. Although I have been putting conscious efforts at making myself better at expressing myself, not much has improved. I am still that ""lato"" guy who is brought up in conversations as an example of someone you should strive to never become. My conversational skill in general is comparable to that of a tree. I can neither initiate nor hold a conversation on my own. The only way I'm ever a part of a conversation is when someone asks me a question and then I answer it. I'm totally blank after answering that question, I have nothing more to add to the conversation, and it's not because I don't want to talk, it's because I genuinely don't know what to talk about. This is one of the many reasons I have a non existent social circle, because people might think it is rude when you don't take a part in the conversation the way they do, it's like you're not putting any effort, but there's only so much I'm capable of. This too falls in the ""things I observe people doing but have never caught up even a bit"" category of skills.

In fact, most of the things I say, I instantly regret. And although I try to be as cautious as I can be, I can still appear to be airheaded, not knowing what I'm even trying to convey in the first place. Even with the best of my intentions, some of what I say might be interpreted as a symbol of rudeness, and when I finally realize what part of my speech was the problem, it's usually too late. I have become the harbinger of miscommunication and a constant failure in maintaining close knit friend groups. I look at the budding friendships around me and try to replicate their aura but instead fail miserably and get even lonelier than before. I can't remember ever having called someone a ""best friend"" or even having an answer to the question of ""Who are your closest friends?"". The spontaneity that people around me have, I could never incorporate it in my personality, no matter how much I tried. I didn't think about anything up until lockdown began, I was in grade 11 back then. It gave me a lot of room for introspection, made me more isolated than ever before, and although the outbreak didn't affect my physical health, it has had a lasting impact on my mental and spiritual health. In some forms, I can say it has been good to me, since I now have the retrospective eye to see where I'm weak, but then again, with not enough means to overturn the weakness, I'm left wondering what good this ability has been.

And in one of my past rants I've seen people say ""you communicated your problems here and you say you're bad at communicating, how come?"". I wish writing something was the same as speaking in the moment. Here in a thread, I could create a context and carve a story however long, and provide my point. Just for example, this thread has already taken me over two days to write completely, and I'm not sure whether I'll finish this today either. But there's a very limited window when speaking and there's a very real possibility that you'll say something you don't mean or something that might hurt the second person. But in writing, you can erase and rewrite as many times as you like. The degree of freedom a text based conversation allows is far greater than a real life interaction. This is why I feel like irl everyone is the person they actually genuinely are, in all their flaws and all their glory. On the internet or in the form of chat/letters, you will only see a cherrypicked version of a person, who decides what to let the other party in on. **I wish talking was the same as writing.**

I haven't grown as much as a person my age would have grown in terms of life in general. The accomplishments typical of my age, the responsibilities, the maturity, the grit and enthusiasm, the strength in both the mind and body, I am clueless as to how it can be achieved. Although I haven't been unlucky in the sense that I have a fully functioning body, a mind without major brain conditions, and a family that has provided for me every day without fail, one thing I have been unlucky in, is myself. An incredibly weak mindset as a fault of nobody but my own. How could somebody with little to no motivation or willpower get anywhere in life? It's not like I haven't identified this prominent issue, I am only fighting an uphill battle and losing miserably so far. Imposter syndrome is a very common occurrence to me, and I don't even have anything to show for it. I know I'm not good enough to be having an impostor syndrome. I'm not a philosophical prodigy, nor am I a genius physicist. But the fact that I'm so far below average and yet I'm taking up Engineering as a degree feels like a betrayal to the field itself.

What I am today is a responsibility of myself. I can't bring someone and just blame it on them and get done with it. What will that change about it anyway? The status quo is that I have not lived up to what anyone who has ever expected anything of me, has ever expected. I have been failing everyone through my life's steps, at least those that have been unguided, but most of all I'm failing myself. I tried all sorts of things to fit in. I even adopted the habit of smoking so that I could be as mature as those who had that habit, but turns out a single habit can never define a person's persona. **I wanted to not become less than average.** But that is precisely what I've ended up becoming. Everyone around me is miles ahead. I try not to think of life as a race, but even if it isn't, it's kind of lonely when you're failing to get your feet running even when you know that's what should be done to keep up.

Ultimately, it feels like nothing interests me any longer. I don't like travelling much. I haven't gone to college even though it has been almost a month since the semester began, frankly because I don't have the willpower to go. I used to make videos on YouTube but it has been a couple of years since I quit, apparently right around when lockdown hit and I started to self reflect.

Some other alien concepts to me are love and relationships. There was a point up until when I didn't really acknowledge the existence of two different genders. I would never associate with another gender and even when I did, I never knew the difference. It was only after a certain point that I knew that there's differences in the society and that is when I started to become afraid. I don't have friends, be it my own gender, or god forbid the other. I've been extra reserved when it came to female interactions, with the most prominent being me letting them copy off my exam papers. But now as an engineering student, there aren't enough girls for even that. I have heard and seen my classmates getting close with each other, some boasted, some tried to keep it a secret, some tried to give advice on what to do and what not to do. But what was that of use to me? I've never had to organically genuinely hold a conversation with a girl in my life.

I adopted social media since 2015, when I got access to the internet for the first time. I was already not much of a social animal up until then and the addition of a pc in the house was a final nail in the coffin that would see me not get out of the house except for school, for prolonged periods of time. I emerged out of it as a socially anxious, maybe even autistic person. I had no personality at all. I couldn't participate in conversations, couldn't relate to what most people say either. As any teen in their prime teenage would, I would be bombarded with my facebook ""friends"" posting about their relationships and what not. Every song I listened to, the same old ""I can't live without you"". I was completely desensitized to everything. It's not like I didn't try either. Ever since I realized these ""relationships"" existed, I had an immense FOMO and tried every channel to maybe get a shot at becoming just like the rest. Even though in real life I wouldn't dare approach anyone, hell I wouldn't ever even hold eye contact, I would be sending messages upon messages to uncountable random people online, because it was easy to do. Just a few buttons doesn't take a lot of willpower to mash. With everything said and done though, there was not a single result to show for all that frantic and desperate attempt to prove to my peers that I was their equal.

Even until past year, I could find myself chasing after non existent hopes and when I finally realized what I had been doing, that left me in a spiral of self doubt, guilt and questioning my entire life in essence. I decided enough was enough and thought that maybe it's time to take a break. And so I did, I took a break from all the social media I used the most. I hoped that this would make me focus more on myself and maybe take my mind off this cycle of self loathing but my psyche had other plans. I still feel unlovable, still haven't taken any major step towards making my parents proud, I'm still unknown to most of the world, practically a nobody at this point.

It's almost like I have given up completely by taking this break. Given up on becoming someone for somebody, given up on the hopes and aspirations the people who raised me have for me, given up on becoming the role model for someone who comes after, given up on becoming a man, given up on becoming a ... human. In terms of a partner, they say if nothing else, there is arranged marriage for everyone. But I'm slowly starting to question whether even that is a feasibility. There would still need to be a compatibility check beforehand, and the way I'm headed, I do not feel like I can even trust the system as a safety net. In a nutshell, **I will probably end up alone.**

To top it off, I could maybe consider this a case of an **incel, but in the true meaning of the word.** Involuntary Celibate, just without any feeling of hatred towards the opposite gender. Because why would I be mad at someone else while they want the same thing as me, to make the right choices at the right time. And how could I expect a person to choose someone as unstable as myself.

Unless I am given a complete step by step guide to perform any action, I will fail miserably at it. Just like a robot that has been programmed to do everything that it does, I too can't think out of the box and I have seen many examples that would verify this claim. Despite my efforts to amend this, there has been no sign of progress and I can't see a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. **Maybe I am doomed to cease as nothing in the end.**

&#x200B;

Okay this is most definitely the longest thread I have ever posted to this platform and also the weakest by my standards, even compared to my past rants, I just couldn't feel the gravity when I wrote this one as immensely as I would have when I first got these feelings. My procrastination and the evident lack of willpower has once again been proven to cement my place as the most pathetic person someone could ever come across. I am sorry for the unrecoverable time you have lost in reading this loathsome piece of text.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr :** *Couldn't learn anything from experience because never had experience in the first place. Stagnating and falling behind and because of that slowly falling apart as a person. Nothing to show for in life even with having had privilege inaccessible to those who would actually make use of what has been given. In a nutshell, a wasted product.*

&#x200B;

I am once again sorry for writing this. My existence is a mistake. I apologize for making you suffer. If you have anything, experiences, suggestions, to-do lists, analysis, anger, sympathy or else, I would deeply appreciate it and I would be immensely grateful to anyone who wouldn't take this as a joke but as a plea for help.

I promise I will write a shorter rant if I ever write again.

1ehz50i,KP Oli and Nepali Political Corruption,"Here is Episode 20 of Guff Suff. In this episode we talk about the corruption in Nepali Politics. How the government changes hands and soon they are doing the dirty work to help their family and goon friends to keep them away from harms way and the LAW, the very same law they built by killing thousands of people in the name of democracy and independence from the monarchy.

Our mind boggles when a senior politician like KP Sharma Oli who became Prime Minister for the 4th term starts to show his power to get everything done for his friends. Doing it right in front of the public eyes without flinching gives shivers and the anger of hate for such a corruption to happen in the open air. Yet, in Nepal there are no resistance coming from any of the other parties or even from the Nepalese people.

It has become habit of us all Nepalese people to take them lightly. As this is not the first time its happening and neither shall it be the last one. We all know this will keep on continuing and we somewhat also know how to end it but it has just been too engraved into our political roots that everyone from top to the bottom of the chain are involved and don't want to risk their political career or their LIFE.

htkk9g,An Indian trying to mend relationships with Nepalis.,"Hey, I am an Indian. I have been lurking on this thread for a couple of days since KP Oli's statement and the shameful incident in Varanasi to get a sense of why is this happening. I realised that a lot of Nepalis have a buried hatred towards India. I am aware that you guys know that every country has its problems and the more the diversity the more there are problems. But I believe that we as humans should know that our primary nature is not violence. Politics uses people to incite hatred and violence, it's a gateway for power for some people.
Now, I don't particularly like Modi. I am not what you will call a 'Bhakt'. I criticize him too. But the only option we have other than Modi is Rahul Gandhi as a PM which I believe is not a good idea. If Rahul Gandhi would've been India's PM right now he would've shit his pants by now because of the kind of problems we are facing at so many fronts.
I agree Modi is not the ideal leader but it's the lesser of the two evils.
We have been partners for over 60 years through thick and thin and I believe that there is still hope and there are still good people who want peace on both the sides.
I still believe that we can rationalise and move beyond this hatred being stemmed in us because of Politicians.
Jai Nepal. Jai Hind


TL;DR - We can overlook the shenanigans of politicians to create a rift between us and rationally choose friendship and peace. Rather than filling ourselves with anger against each other, together condemn racist acts like the Varanasi incident and ensure that the divide and rule politics doesn't work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/htkk9g/an_indian_trying_to_mend_relationships_with/,7/18/2020 17:35,59,0,61,English,0,1,0,1,0,0
16937us,Life is full of temporary people.,"Idk where to start. I am a 20M about to be 21 never ever had real friends. People come they use me take my everything win my trust what not and boom they leave. Just giving a example of my neighbour/friend she is my only friend I had. We share a fabulous bonding. She look good together. Everything is platonic from both sides. She is just one month elder exactly one month. And what happens she left the country yesterday and I came to know all this today. No farewell no handshake with a friend who is with you for almost 21 years? Is that the worth of life. 

Another friend just texts me when they need moral support and when I text them I came to know my number isn't even saved and they are like who are you. 9 years of friendship is that the worth. 

During the times of assignment I noted I was in call with 26 people in a single day and they all were asking my advice. But after the submission no one cares. Even when I need blood for urgent matters as someone was in hospital bed. No reply. Really that's the friendship. 

I know one thing I am not a good friend or they don't know how to keep friends. I surely have no friends they are just people whom I know. 

I try to help may people I can. I even help strangers and feel empayfor everyone everything. Why I don't know why do I feel like shit everyday. I try to do my job someone won't let me. I try to study some one got urgent issue. I want to go abroad my family needs me.

When will my time come seriously. Yuck my life is filled with misery and hell no I won't give up. I just want to fight but I think I lost my sword. I have no energy left. No fort is left to fight for. Just anger. 

I know this is not my best self but seriously I am unable to find way.

Yes he has a good voice but its not like the greatest voice there is. He is completely overrated. And the other thing is he doesn't connect with the American audience. Katy Perry's comments about him having his eyes closed have angered a lot of AG fans but hey, that's kinda right. As much as shows like American Idol are about music and vocal talents, it is also partly about the character. And as one, you need to be able to gel with the audience.

&#x200B;

I think its silly to simply go online and vote 300 times for him just because he is Nepali. I think he's a great Nepali singer and his talents will take him far but for him to make a dent in American music will take a bit more than this.

olfnw0,A ten year old guy who wrote very weird message to me got married yesterday.,"Edit :Someone ten year older than me sorry for my bad English 🤣🤣🤣

 My parents were involved in a social organisation and I too have recently joined it. This guy we, me and my mom meet for the first time in a national program and he is from another local club. My father was in big position in this organisation so he is respected person. I am good not best, at socialising and will talk to anyone very politely until you mess up. I talked normally like I will to anyone, very professionally with this guy. Also in this organisation I am very young member, usually people are 10-15 years older range than me. I am in my 20s and this man must be in his late 20s or early 30s. One day surprisingly this man writes these weird flirty message to me, boarder line harassment kind of message. This would have unfazed me normally but the fact that this guy knows my parents, knows that I can bring this forward and kind of ruin his career in this organisation still wrote these messages to me. Like kuddos to this man's himat. And I don't know what he think he will achieve because I am really young than him. 

So to the main point now, this man got married yesterday and my mom was invited to his party😒😒.

quoapz,Negative Vibes,"Hello r/Nepal
I usually don’t post here much but had to get it out.
I saw numerous comments dragging each other out here keeping aside sarcasm and bits. I don’t think we nepalese are so uptight and rude irl. 
I for one cannot see any sign of humbleness out here. 

Do you guys vent and pour your anger out here? I thought subs are meant to bring people together, share experiences, help each other out. 

I used to be rude and uptight myself. I later realized the essence of being humble,being kind and generous have a tremendous positive wave on me and around me. 

So I advice all of you to try and loosen up a little, live a little, create a positive atmosphere where new users don’t feel dominated and mocked. 

Positivity reflects from you negativity shatter nobody but you from within.

i22bzi,An Indian trying to understand Nepal better.,"Hi, so I'll just jump to the topic. I am very troubled by the recent drift between our countries and even more so by comments and anger shown on social media via misplaced nationalism and talking down each other's countries. This won't help the people in either country or resolve the issue. My understanding from an Indian perspective is that the best option is to maintain the status-quo or go for international court for judgement. India has gone for this route with Bangladesh and actually given back land in net exchange and revision of borders. I would like to hear options to resolve this issue rather than discuss who is right or wrong like in previous many posts here.

The only thing I know is I am done with everything and tired of hiding things for the sake of “family” and “relatives”. I was sexually violated by my mother’s then boyfriend(extra marital affair) when I was little.  It continued for quite a long time. His influence in my life continued since then. I had talked to my mother after few years about the incident and she chose to ignore me and didn’t even question him. She didn’t even thought of separating her own life with mine and continuously let him near me making him my “dad”. The few people I tried to talk to couldn’t grasp the idea about how a mother like this can exist. The fear he planted in my brain by showing his “power” over me and ridiculing me about how my own mother doesn’t trust my word, made me shut myself. The frustration and anger has build up so much inside me because of how they ruined my life even after I detach myself from the whole thing. I have been fighting depression ever since. I have tried counseling but failed to continue because I couldn’t get the guts to talk about the roots of my problem and rather talked about other issues. This didn’t seem fruitful at all. I have seen many psychiatrists as well. The medication alone doesn’t seem to work much for me. I still have so much to say.I am posting this anonymously because he is a Nepal Police official himself so I don’t know if I can go to the police. I can talk about every details but I don’t know how and to whom. If I get proved wrong I am ready to face my consequences too. Anyone please  give me an idea about how do I do this.

qenwnx,Unsupportive Parents.,"Do any of you have unsupportive parents? Mine are unsupportive and condescending at the same time. I am 24/M. To begin with, my parents especially my father, did not allow me touch his motorbike till I was in high school. The moment he got to know I had been secretly learning, I got full on lecture to focus on my studies. Now that, I am on the verge of completing my bachelors, both of them suddenly started yapping about how some other kids know how to ride motorbikes, bring groceries, and the typical ""falano her license banaera car chadne bhaisakyo"". This was when I fucking had it, because all these years until few months ago, I was asking my father to atleast give me the keys of the motorcycle so that in lockdown,I would atleast learn how to ride properly with confidence....But the answer was NO!! or bholi or simply silence.

So, I fucking had it when they were going on and on about this issue.... and I asked my father to give the keys of motorcycle...silence is all I got.... Finally I asked for some money with some of friends, joined a driving institute and ended up paying almost 3500 for some 20-22 days of 1 hr riding. and got my license.

Even to this my father's response was: aile pura tyo jali license banairachan....kunchai le thagyo hola eslai...jannu sannu kei chaina .......

I took a step back, as to not disappoint him by venting my anger at this..... This was many of incidents, where I would feel, what in the world did I do to get this resentment?  This was the very reason I moved out 3 years back...... I think we Nepalis must leave house once we reach 18-19. At the very least it will give you sanity....the older I get the more I realise how fucked up my parents actually are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/qenwnx/unsupportive_parents/,10/24/2021 8:14,54,0,23,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,1,1,0,1,2
1756dm7,Aftermath and Peace,"I went thru something, that broke me from inside. So, I was in relationship with this girl for one and half, and for half, it was long distance. She was cute, she still is, and has beautiful voice. We grew in love gradually. Ramro thyo, we were intimate, and loving. Intercaste thyo, but it wasnt issue, we never really cared. And yedi it went on, i was ready to tell my parents, they are chill people, they dont care, i know. 

Tara ek din, mailey bihana call garey, rati call garda, ek ring janxa and busy, i thought she might be busy tehi vhaera katya hola. But She blocked me. 3 din i was like wtf. i couldnt contact her anymore. Ani i found out ki, she was seeing someone else. I was devasted. like, i never imagined this would happen to me. I was feeling emasculated, i was full of anger. I am not that controlling, so i didnt ask for her ID password during our relationship.  I didnt get jelous if she talks with other guy. I really loved her, gave my all and beyond. I dont think i deserve to be ridiculed k. Yedi she would have said ""Our love is getting cold"" or even  ""I like someone else"". I would have reason to just move on k. I was just left on block and cheated on (I dont know if u call it cheating, cause she had blocked me already, but for me its cheating). 

I was vengeful lastai. ""bahini pataidinxu, ani see u in dashain"" wala samma vhanam. cause it did really hurt me. Cause if she fell out of love faster than we fell in, was it even love? maya xodxu riss hunthyo, riss xodxu maya matra hunthyo. maan bata nikaley ni dimaag ma chai rahi rahanthyo. 

But yesterday, i was listening to aruarian dance and Ladyfingers, out in balcony, and lied down. and looked back. With her, it wasnt bad after all. Mero yo 4th relationship thyo, usko first thyo, maybe she had more expectations, like all day will be honeymoon and roses type. I guess, first time everybody thinks that way. she was joly, hasney gauney type, i loved quiet life. She didnt appreciate it cause she doesnt know anything else beside me. I dont want to question if it was love, i wanna believe it was, I wanna believe when she said love you, she meant it. I mean moveon garna ta time lagxa, cause for me, i was like, ""this is it, its her"" so, i dont know. tara atleast i made peace with myself. i m just worried, it has given me trust issues, ani maybe even be controlling pahila bhanda, but i dont know. its my thing to figure out. Ani usley kina xodyo, arko kta ma k dekhyo, tyo ni i dont wanna know. if i have weakness, she left me to figure out myself. 

So miss pulami, i forgive u. not only because i deserve peace, but u also deserve forgiveness. malai dekhni bitikai bhagnu pardaina. i m salty about it no more. Tehi i wish u appreciated ""us"" more. i m thankful for year and half. And U have made me, better person many ways. I guess its the end of chapter.

w23eew,How to politely decline burrowing vehicle to your friends/neighbor?,"So today a neighbor of mine asked for my scooty saying he will be back within an hour. He even told me he will first fill the petrol and then use it. I handed him my keys and went back to study. Few hours passed and he didn't return. His phone was switched off and he finally returned back home at around 8:30. Dude handed me the keys, did some small talks and finally tells me ""bhai aja tel halna bhyaina bholi tira halamla hai"". I was so angry inside but all I could tell him was ""kei bhayena, bhai halcha ni"". What's even the point of unleashing the anger, right?


Fuel is so expensive right now and it's going to cost me 4-500 just to take back the meter at its previous point. And, I am unemployed. The guy surely wont refuel it but I have learned my lesson. Since I won't be letting anyone my scooter from next time, I need to make excuses and make it seem like I need it for myself. What are the common excuses you people make when such situation arise and also not be rude.

g0gcei,Some thoughts about recovering from depression (another part of me asking help here 2 months ago),"Hi everyone. It's been awhile. I am fine. Haven't committed suicide yet. I felt compelled to write here about my experience as I was reached out by many people over the period of two months. I didn't reply to people properly as I was not using reddit as frequently. But nevertheless I am on my way to recover. 
I am consulting a psychologist instead. Not Dr. Ravi Shakya. I also left Nepal. Ran away perhaps. I'm in Delhi. Not sure what's gonna happen next. 

I wrote here to tell you all, whoever needs it, if you feel like you need help, seek help. Find a psychologist. The psychiatrist did not do much for me. He kept giving me meds and told me it will be fine. But all that happened was the meds made me numb. To everything. Sadness, happiness, anger. No emotions. So when I left Nepal, I stops taking those pills and 2 weeks later found a psychologist. I still have sessions with her. And she clarified me a lot of things. 

So choose a psychologist if you want help. I'm sure people here/around you can help you find a good one. The journey is painful. I breakdown every session I have with the psychologist. But it is indeed going somewhere. So be brave. Face it. 

And lastly, thank you to all those who supported me during such a hard time. Seriously. Thank you all.

m9qf73,How do you measure happiness? Nepal happiest nation in South Asia - Nagarik News. Bhutan not on the list.,"So i read this news from [Nagarik News](https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/social-affairs/482651-1616225572.html) that says Nepal is the happiest nation in South Asia and 87th globally.

This had me wondering what the parameters of ""happiness"" are which is such a subjective term and controversial to some extent. Say a person born into family on the verge of starvation starts making minimum wage when they grow up. Surely they will be happy since their status has improved? or will they remain unhappy thinking they make minimum wage not more? 

To find this i looked at methodology of the report. Nagarik News says 

>बितेका तीन वर्षमा गरिएको सर्वेक्षणका आधामा खुसी देशहरुको सूची निकालिएको हो। स्वस्थकर औसत आयु, सामाजिक सुरक्षा, सामाजिक स्वतन्त्रता र भ्रष्टाचारको अवस्थालाई अध्ययनको सूचक मानिएको छ।

The rankings were based on ""Subjective Well being"" and ""Life evaluation"" that says:

>Our measurement of subjective well-being relies on three main indicators: life evaluations, positive emotions, and negative emotions (described in the report as positive and negative affect). Our happiness rankings are based on life evaluations, as the more stable measure of the quality of people’s lives. In World Happiness Report 2021, we pay more attention than usual to specific daily emotions (the components of positive and negative affect) to better track how COVID-19 has altered different aspects of life.

As vague as it is, they use polls to determine ""life evaluation""

>**Life** **evaluations**. The Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data in this report, asks respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. Each respondent provides a numerical response on this scale, referred to as the Cantril ladder. Typically, around 1,000 responses are gathered annually for each country. Weighted averages are used to construct populationrepresentative national averages for each year in each country. We base our usual happiness rankings on a three-year average to increase the sample size to give more precise estimates. This year, in order to focus on the effects of COVID-19, we consider how life evaluations and emotions in 2020 compare to their averages for 2017-2019.   
>  
>**Positive emotions**. Respondents to the Gallup World Poll are asked whether they smiled or laughed a lot yesterday and whether they experienced enjoyment during a lot of yesterday. For each of these two questions, if a person says no, their response is coded as 0. If a person says yes, their response is coded as a 1. We calculate the average response for each person, with values ranging from 0 and 1. When needed, we use weighted averages across all individuals surveyed within a country to give national averages for positive affect.   
>  
>**Negative emotions**. Negative affect is measured by asking respondents whether they experienced specific negative emotions during a lot of the day yesterday. Negative affect, for each person, is given by the average of their yes or no answers about three emotions: worry, sadness, and anger. National averages are created in the same way as for positive affect.   
>  
>**Comparing life evaluations and emotions:**  
>  
> • Life evaluations provide the most informative measure for international comparisons because they capture quality of life in a more complete and stable way than emotional reports based on daily experiences.   
>  
>• Life evaluations differ more between countries than emotions and are better explained by the widely differing life experiences in different countries. Emotions yesterday are well explained by events of the day being asked about, while life evaluations more closely reflect the circumstances of life as a whole. But we find and will show later in the chapter that emotions are significant supports for life evaluations. • Positive emotions are almost three times more frequent (global average of 0.71) than negative emotions (global average of 0.27).

The findings of this poll was further explained by factors like average income, life expectancy etc. Mind you that the primary data was poll not these social factors while making the rankings. The report says:

>We remind readers that the rankings in Figure 2.1 depend only on the average life evaluations reported by respondents in the Gallup surveys, and not on our model to explain the international differences. The first six sub-bars for each country/ territory reflect our efforts to attribute the reported life evaluation score in that country to its average income, life expectancy and four social factors.

These people are much more qualified than I am. And i am not denying anything here. I am just skeptical of how truly they reflect a nation. Can one part of society overshadow the other by simply virtue of access to such international platforms? Or are these reports a way to over exaggerate a minority in a country? How much does propaganda play a role to skew such reports? Do you think a country where free press is absent, would report reality in such surveys or would simply report what the state wants under pressure or fear of some sort?

hrvwyf,Love relation with nepal & why was it never colonized!!,"Nepal a very close ally of India so far, have taken a persistent approach now to go self reliant from India as a whole. Almost 75% of commodities that Nepal gets comes from India, not to forget the essentials are included as well.
Many a times India having its own problem as a nation do fails to help its neighbours the way they want to. No surprise, this creates a bit of anguish and anger among the masses, but this is to be understood that history has been a witness that India has never shown any prejudice regarding its all weather ally Nepal.
Now comes the statement that India wants to annex the part of territory that Nepal claims as theirs and India as its, because for the last 7 decades the Indian forces have been patrolling the region and no doubt Nepal did raise concern about the region several times before, during using of the area as a trade pass between India & China, during passing of the construction of work for Amarnath Yatra.
Retaliating to the India media, now often seen just to lurk onto everything the way they percieve it and not about what the masses think about it, the Nepalese have started doing the same. We Indians do no want any kind of bad relations with Nepal. We love the Nepalese and we do get loved in return.
The most famous notion that the Nepalese boast is that they were never under any kind of annexation from Britishers or portuguese.
Talking of which, Nepal is a landlocked country and looking at the British East India company they wanted trade but with time looking at the poor management of the country's regime they colonized India. But Nepal, was never on their list, afterall what purpose would it have served? Trading with China from India required landmasses which the Britishers had in their grasp. And still when the wanted the Himalayan passes they asked the Nepali rulers of that time to give it them, for which they refused and got into a tussle with the Britishers, obviously they lost the war as the Britishers were more logistically prepared and tactically advanced. So they surrendered before the Britishers. For the economic losses the war generated they gave up their land which is now a part of India and to put it on paper they signed the treaty so called the Sugaoli treaty thus surrendering their land to the Britishers and stopping the war there and then before loosing the entire of Nepal to the British. A move good enough to protect its sovereignty as they were sure that it would be jeopardised if they went any further.
Britishers had literally no use of Nepalese territory but for the trade they took over the lipulekh pass, which obviously the Nepalese ruler dared not to interfere, the pass was used for trade then. So, Nepal has no coastal areas, no plains as India for growing agriculture, so the ultimate purpose of trade was not seen in Nepal and thus was Nepal left out. So calling Nepal a territory brave enough never to be colonized is a fool's talk, because it did not serve the Britisher's interest.
And please we do not want to annex your territory, this was to happen sooner or later but under the influence of a third country spoiling the relations is not good. Even India needs to learn from its mistakes of ignoring several calls of Nepal. Plus Nepalese if India would have wanted to take the territory u claimed as yours, it would have been a different game. We are still open hearted to you, hope you realize it soon. Boasting of never being colonized won't make the most powerful country.

P.s. These are my personal views and in no way is to target anyone. If i have offended anyone i am extremely sorry.

ilurtw,Different sides of the Patan Riot- A curious Case of Citizen Involvement,"Disclaimer: I have no dog in this game. This is just an observation. As an observer I have presented my viewpoint. It may upset you, or you may not care but it's a viewpoint, nothing more. The only impact it can have is that it will only take away the time you spend to read it.

Cultural Identity is one of the strongest drivers of Nepali society as signified by the two cases of citizen involvement in recent memory. The first is the Guthi Bill Protest and the second is the Patan Riot of Rato Machindranath Jatra. The stark contrast between these protests is the court of public opinion on the first  case was with the protesters but the second case is yet to be decided. Here are different sides of the arguments.

**Riot was insensitive**  
Majority of individuals in social media believe that it was insensitive to hit the police. Rightfully so, these individuals believe violence is never the answer. The idea was to hold a cultural event, organized as a symbol of hope during these trying times and the kind of behavior shown by the rioters is not commendable. The anger and frustration of the general people should be focused towards decision makers and not a single particular public servant.

**Culture Trumps COVID**  
The preparation for the Jatra was weeks of planning and tradition is what binds us in these trying times. The lack of management from the governments side is extremely disloyal to the public. It's almost an act of vengeance. The lack of sympathy shown as the government decided to have a lockdown right after the taxes were collected and decided to imprison citizens in their homes with select elites getting privileges of mobility is discriminatory. Government is for the people and by the people and its not on us to be the sacrificial goat every time the leaders cannot handle a situation. Either let us do our thing with complete freedom or move out of the way.

**DON'T HOLD CROWD EVENTS**  
COVID is spreading like wildfire and its on us to stop spreading the virus. The government is incompetent and thus, we have to help each-other. Do not hold public events until the virus is mitigated.

Regardless of whichever of these viewpoints you have, you must understand that it is not an isolated incident. Nepali public have been known to riot/protest/fight against anything that harms their identity. Any time our cultural identity or public identity is threatened ""Our Bir Gorkhali"" gene acts up against these events. Examples are Hrithik Roshan riots, 12 Nepali citizens death at the hands of Terrorists, encroachment of Limpiadhura. Now, the only difference this time is that it was a small sect of people in Nepal acting against Nepali officials. The sad reality is that each time we Nepali citizens resort to violence, Bir Gorkhali gene can do nothing else I guess.

Also, COVID-19 has been the sword that has been hanging in our heads for far too long. The lack of management in the initial four months of the first lockdown and attempt of reopening just to collect taxes and then a second lockdown shows a predatory behavior from the government. It is an entrapment scheme where the government gets what it wants while providing none of the resources we pay the government for. The procurement of PCR kits, hospital beds, Ventilator and management of the isolation wards is minimal. 

Even the public admits the government cannot handle this and that is the reason why we have to defeat it by ourselves. Question remains, whats the use of the government? To imprison us in our own homes? Why pay taxes then if they cannot provide us the services? I don't know. Ask yourself.

This is a complex issue. Today, the rioters used violence and took the streets for a cultural cause without safety considerations. This was truly a blunder on their part. But the the anguish and the frustration from the public is not going to go away. Today, the court of public opinion is on government's side but if things remain the same, the next protest might just be something the government may not be able to handle. It is not a prediction, it's a spoiler.

whuq3g,I imagine a day where the Nepal Gov. says Enough is Enough and finally bans TikTok.," TikTok Ban for Nepal is a must have.

• China (country of origin) - disables TikTok entirely, instead has its own version ""Douyin"" which is a whole different universe than the tiktok we have.

• India - Bans TikTok. After the Chinese and Indian Army disputs.

• Pakistan - Bans/Unbans TikTok 4 times. Reason ""Immoral-inappropriate Content"". TikTok's Damage Control : give ""reassurance"" that it will Block unwanted content in Pakistan.

• Afganistan - Taliban Tookover, then banned it.

• Indonesia - Bans Tiktok for Pornographic and inappropriate content. TikTok's Damage Control ""Promised them that they'll censor"" .

• Australia - calling to ban Tiktok because they believe user data can be shared with the CCP.

• U.S.A - calling Apple Appstore and Google Playstore to outright remove tiktok because of ties with ccp, security reason, and the dishonesty from the chinese company Bytedance.

i open tiktok. first thing i see, a Silicone Vagina Toy illustration on how to use period tampon. i mean, even if its educational there's no label of the age restriction in there. i scroll down once, i see 19-20-21...girls doing these thirst trap dances. i scroll down one more time. 3d animation of sperm entering pathways to the ovaries.

ffs. the app is 90% about sex and 10% is another worthless garbage. 3rd hand information.

What do you think about the hypocrisy of Nepal not banning the thing even with these ludicrous thirst trap for target audience of horny underage teen boys and while Banning non porn sites like Urban Dictionary and such cuz they are kept under the same label as porn. idk why is it?

does this have something to do with Nepal not wanting to anger china ? or what. i don't understand. 

Lets imagine together when TikTok gets banned.:   
\- alternative would be instagram reels or youtube shorts.   
\- Exclusive Nepali content wont show up. because tiktok Steals your simcard Phone number data to determine from which country you are using the app and bounds you to the same country countents. YouTube shorts / Insta Reels may or maynot have this. if it doesn't Nepali creator should make Extra ordinary content to stand out . thus the normie cringe Jokers will disappear and only good ones will remain.  
\- there won't be ""TikTok"" stars.  
\- there wont' be Movie Models just cuz they got millions of views on TikTok on some half minute video. Fucking shallow girls born out a fluke, while several models wait in line like before the internet. Now after tiktok if they wanna be a model they'll have to compete with the whole world not just Nepal to make a Several views video.  
\- there won't be circulation of American Memes, and Gen Z culture grab from different places. you'll have to make your own like how Nepali Troll Pages in Facebook were born. You can't go using Kpop, stranger things,""sheesh"", ""bruh"", - korean style dress, and other shitty ideas you see on tiktok.  
\- third hand information will cease to exist ."" Mailey tyo tiktok ma dekheko they ni"" vandai noonilo aalu chop banayera khana chodcha and instead, youtube chef tutorial or recipebook padhi banauna thalchan. 3rd hand information is good sometimes, but from tiktok, then its always for clout. so avoid at all costs. 

&#x200B;

TikTok made a huge mistake with buzzfeed news leaking that tiktok emplyees said that china stores user data. it just needs to make some more stupid mistakes to be banned and once USA bans it , its game over. it'll disappear like Huawei.

Atleast , some historical places in Nepal are taking steps to ban",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/whuq3g/i_imagine_a_day_where_the_nepal_gov_says_enough/,8/6/2022 18:20,1,0,1,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,0,2
pdewtz,Was Prithivi Narayan Shah really cursed by Baba Gorakhnath or is it just a folktale?,"STORY:

So, Baba Gorakhnath was one of the followers of Matsyendra Nath(the same matsyendra nath which newars worship). He was meditating in a cave near Gorkha palace and he saw a playful child roaming arouund, the child was PN Shah. He asked young PN Shah to bring some curd. The prince rushed to the palace and and asked his mother to give him some curd as alm to the saint few minutes later he came there with curd as asked by the saint. The saint took the curd in his mouth and spat those on the hands of PN Shah. PN Shah was confused by this then the saint asked him to eat up  the curd.

PN SHAH then threw the curd off his hand out of disgust and all the curd miraculously landed on his ten  toes.

On seeing this Baba Gorakh Nath said, ""If you had swallowed this then every words spoken by you would have come to reality but it landed on your feet so every land that you step on will be yours, you disobeyed me and these curd landed on your ten toes as a result your generation will only rule over this kingdom for ten upcoming generation and they will be dethroned because of their anger.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/pdewtz/was_prithivi_narayan_shah_really_cursed_by_baba/,8/28/2021 18:14,4,0,8,English,0,0,0,0,0,0

gi2cgd,Kalapani and Darchula Issue!!!," Am I the only one scratching my head about the extraordinary outbursts of surprise, astonishment, and anger coming from the Kathmandu media after India announced that it had completed the building of a road to Lipu Lekh?! What planet have people been living on?! India declared publicly that it was going to build this road over a decade ago. Over that period, numerous Indian pilgrims, following the officially approved trail (by India and China) over Lipu Lekh to travel to Manasarovar and Kailash. 

For decades the Nepal government was sleeping on the Darchula region with no proper health facilities and infrastructure. The region was totally cut out of Government radar and people were on their own. DCL folks migrating for 6 months to their village to make the living ends what was the government doing at that time? There is still no proper motorcade that connects Darchula to the rest of Nepal. People in Darchula walk on foot and no one has a car or a bike because there is no road. Most of the people from Darchula prefer traveling to Kathmandu through India there is no proper road that connects darchula to the nearest Nepalese city and when people travel through Nepal from darchula for most of them it ends up being there last journey cuz the road is so poor that most vehicles have slid from the road ending up in a ditch and killing everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/gi2cgd/kalapani_and_darchula_issue/,5/12/2020 2:37,24,0,11,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

j5m9mq,Where is the Friend in Need?,"You must all have heard the definition of a friend. The real friend is the one who is there in the time of need. It is a simple knowledge of life. Using this simple measure of a true friend, we can with absolute certainty declare that Nepal’s government, especially the central government, is not a friend of the people. Otherwise, there would not be such heart-breaking news splashed on the front cover of a national daily that tells us how the poorest of the poor are starving to death while [relief packages are rotting in the storage room](https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/52456/2020-10-05).

Nepal to an astute observer is like a house monkey. It even wears clothes and lives in a home with humans and acts like humans. It can dance and play, but essentially it is still a monkey that lives in a tree. Nepal is like a monkey performing a bicycle ride in a circus. But we find a circus monkey very funny, and in this day and age of viral videos, such a monkey would gain millions of views if posted on the Internet. Nepal is that monkey and it would give us a lot of pleasure had the reality not been the opposite. People dying of hunger and neglect are not funny even for the cruelest of the satanic soul. But our government is just that.

On the one hand, there is food rotting in the store, whereas those who it was meant to be distributed are not getting any of it. There are many evil practices being exposed by this heart-wrenching tragedy. How could such an event even be possible? Well, in Nepal impossible becomes possible.

First, the central government has no ability to work properly. It is the Communist government, so nothing better can be expected of them. A person with a heart does not become a Communist. Only those who follow attractive slogans and are mindless are taken by a failed philosophy and then impose it on Nepal. Asking a Communist to have compassion is like expecting a cat to guard the gate at night. It does not fall in its nature.

This government has no capacity to understand the meaning of data otherwise when there are more than 258,000 people living in abject poverty, the relief package was sent only for fewer than 82,000 families. As the relief was going to be short, the local representatives chose to lock them up and refrain from distributing because it would have caused utter chaos and anger in the community. That in essence is Communist rule history in the world. Killing and letting die comes naturally to them.

Some of the local representatives refused to receive aid from the state and the center because they were not getting enough to distribute too all who qualified. That was a saner decision in this ironic situation. However, in other localities, the relief packages were not reaching the true deprived population. In some places, the local government was keeping the packages and the CIAA had to take action.

The most alarming failure of the government has been evident when the state government official responded to the query why there was a shortfall in sending relief, like the example above of sending for fewer than 82,000 families when there are more than 258,000 families. He said there was no time to think it through. Because of the emergency, they could not plan properly.

If so then why bothers at all? We can see that they only want to give an impression of doing something, and meeting the need is not in their view. There has not been any supervision nor any follow up on the relief distribution program. Hence it was a downright failure. Instead, it is a lose-lose-lose situation because the poor do not get the help, the food is rotting in the storage and the money has been spent from the state coffers.

A saner option would have been to give the food and money to non-profit organizations, who could have raised even more funds because of government participation. In this regard, individuals, and non-profits that have been feeding the hungry in Tundikhel every evening have been far more humane and responsible than the government at all three levels.

In Birgung, a friend of mine runs a non-profit called Sano Paila, and they were feeding the hungry people by raising funds from friends all over, but they were told to shut down the operation by the state government because they said the state would take over the feeding themselves. Imagine how cruel that is. Any good government would have tried to help them and increase the operation because the aim of the government must be to solicit the participation of all sectors of the society and especially in times of crisis.

There is more than adequate evidence from the past 10 years that Nepal has been infested by parasites. Those who seek to lead and govern should be seeped in serving mankind, not fighting to abuse government funds for their personal pleasures and comfort. They should have a life of sacrifice, not murdering innocent people, and being an acting agent of foreign powers.

Better sooner than later, these days should be over and these people put in their proper places. Nepal is absolutely on the wrong track. It is like a piece of wood infested with termites. Pest control is long due.

While respecting the verdict of the Kathmandu District Court, it is crucial to express individual opinions within the bounds of due respect for the legal system.

The following reflections are solely my personal opinions, and I have drawn references from multiple news media sources in Nepal. My intent is not to undermine the court's decision but to address concerns related to extreme comments made by some individuals. I am neither a supporter nor a follower of Sandeep, but I feel compelled to discuss the matter of extremist comments.

I do not assert Sandeep's innocence, as he has been found guilty by the Kathmandu District Court. However, I hold the belief that the judgments may appear unfair in the context of Sandeep Lamichhane. I am open to sharing my perspective over time, detailing why I hold this view.

It is our understanding that courts operate based on substantial proof, which, in Sandeep's case, might not convincingly establish guilt. The decision seems to rely heavily on testimonial evidence, potentially influenced by certain Women's Rights INGOs in Nepal, as indicated by various news sources. This influence may have played a role in shaping the overall verdict.

The case initially seemed to favor Lamichhane, but the final decision shifted the narrative dramatically, despite a lack of substantial evidence proving rape. This prompts the concern that verdicts solely based on the victim's statement could potentially implicate innocent individuals, turning any breakup story into a grave accusation.

Regarding the incident's background, it is noteworthy that the victim was a fan of Lamichhane, and their introduction occurred through a common friend. They communicated on Snapchat for a short duration before meeting. The subsequent events, as described, present complexities that deserve careful consideration:

1. It is important to recognize that the occurrence of rape is not mandatory in a closed room.

2. Determining the nature of consensual activities, whether with or without the girl's consent, remains uncertain due to the lack of evidence beyond her statement.

&#x200B;

I raise these points because the evidence to prove Sandeep's guilt seems limited to her statement. It is crucial to note that the victim filed the case 21 days after the incident, following Sandeep blocking her on social media, a detail he attributes to distractions while preparing for a cricket game in Kenya.

A noteworthy piece of evidence includes the victim's message to her best friend the day after the incident, expressing happiness about hugging Sandeep Lamichhane. The statement from her hostel roommate, obtained from [NepalPress.com](https://NepalPress.com), also describes the victim's joyful demeanor in the days following the incident. These factors, along with CCTV footage showing them happily entering and exiting, raise significant questions about the case.

Here is the part of the victim's hostel roommate (as written in NepalPress) : 

""घटना भएको भनिएको भोलिपल्ट मिति २०७९/०५/०६ गते बेलुका करिब ५ बजे म आफ्नो अफिसबाट फर्केपछि निजसँग हामी बस्ने कोठामा नै भेट भएको थियो । उक्त दिन निज एकदमै खुशी देखिन्थिन् । निज खुशी हुँदै म र हामीसँगै बस्ने अर्को रुममेटलाई समेत ‘मैले सन्दीप लामिछानेलाई भेटेँ, हामी हिजो नगरकोट गयौं । मेरो लाइफको सबैभन्दा खुशीको पल नै हिजो थियो’ भनेकी थिइन् । सो कुराकानी भएको भोलिपल्टदेखि नै निज पीडितले सन्दीपको नाउँको जर्सी लगाएर ल्यापटपमा खुसी भएर हुटिङ गर्दै क्रिकेट हेरेर बस्ने गर्थिन् । निज त्यति धेरै खुशी भएको त्योभन्दा पहिला मैले देखेको थिइनँ । त्योबीचमा निजको व्वाई फ्रेन्डसँग पनि निजको भेट हुने गर्थ्यो । २०७९/०५/१४ गतेसम्म निज एकदमै खुशी थिइन् ।""

 

which roughly translates to this in English :

&#x200B;

""The day after the incident happened on 2079/05/06 at around 5:00 PM, I met her in our living room when I returned from my office. She looked very happy that day. She happily told me and another roommate living with us, 'I met Sandeep Lamichhane, we went to Nagarkot yesterday. ""Yesterday was the happiest moment of my life,"" she said. From the day after that conversation, the victim used to watch cricket while wearing a jersey with Sandeep's name on the laptop happily. I had never seen him so happy before. In the meantime, he used to meet with his boyfriend. She was very happy till 2079/05/14.""

&#x200B;

In conclusion, this matter is one of serious concern, and it is imperative that a fair and just judgment is delivered, considering all relevant evidence and perspectives.

1ccpr0h,Greatest Act of Altruism and Kindness I have encountered.,"  

Few days back I had posted in reddit a help post for a 4 year old boy from Saptari belonging to marginalized and poor family in dire need of money for his upcoming surgery. Amount needed was about 50,000 rupees and I was expecting may be a help of few thousands in total. The boy was admitted in the BPKIHS pediatric ward and many undergraduate students have donated money for the treatment. So, I posted it in reddit thinking it would be of some help.

Then, a guy from Nepal currently in Sydney, Australia took a keen interest in donation and I provided him extra details. I told him the amount needed and surgery timing. To my surprise that guy donated rupees 50,000 to the child. The amount has reached to the child. I was amazed and kind of positive about the kindness that is still present in this world. On top of that the person doesn’t want to reveal his name. I salute his selfless philanthropy. 

To you, the unsung hero reading this, wherever you may be, my gratitude knows no bounds. Your selfless act has not only changed the trajectory of one child's life but has also touched the hearts of all who've witnessed your incredible kindness. May blessings rain down upon you and your loved ones, may joy fill your days, and may the universe repay your generosity a thousand fold. From the depths of my soul, and on behalf of the relieved family and grateful students of BPKIHS, thank you.

1ao32wq,How do I deal with my mother continuously belittling me?,"One of my friends is critically ill and I have been helping him any way I can (also requesting others to help) since he is from a very poor financial background and none of his relatives help. My mother tells me that I don't focus on my family and try to please others because my parents are having relationship troubles and they fight all the time and she thinks it's my job to intervene between them and maintain peace in the family. She said ""talai aafno pariwaar bigreko matlab chhaina, aru laai sahayog gardai hidh"" and when I asked how I could help, she said that I have to control the relationship between her and my father. I did what I could to the best of my ability. I talked to both of them separately and asked them to sit together and communicate their issues. While doing this I couldn't hold my tears back watching them argue and blaming each other. I cried so much after it was over. It was apparent that lack of communication was the main problem. Now it's back to normal but my mother thinks I should do this every time things go out of hand in their relationship. How can a son be the mediator between his father and mother who argue daily and demand divorce and try painting each other as abusive in their children's eyes.
Currently I am not earning well so she takes every chance she gets to belittle my choice to help my friend (who would die if i did nothing as his treatment requires a substantial amount of money and none of his relatives help).
I used to work in a small company earning decent money but due to the financial crisis I was let go and then I decided to work for myself by registering my own company. But I have been struggling to find projects of construction (mostly buildings). So I can't contribute much to my home. My parents run a hotel so family expenditure is not an issue if there are no extravagant expenses for luxury (which we don't even want as we were very very poor when I was a toddler).
My mother is quite controlling. She wants to tell people (not just me) what to do, what to eat, how to eat, where to exactly sit while you eat, whom you should/must marry, etc. and I have learned to deal with it since I was a child. I just give what she wants and it's easy for me.
I can take the controlling behavior but not the belittling part. I have also decided not to marry because I cannot ruin someone's daughter's life just to please my mother because I know my mother will criticize each and everything my future wife would do. And even if my mother gets everything she wants, she still won't be happy. How do I know? Trust me, I do. 
Today, when I was talking to some people and discussing how we can buy rice packets (20 kg ko chaamal ko boraa) for my sick friend, my mother chimed in and said ""eslai k vannu? Khurukka gaihaal paisa kamaauna. Kina garnu paro sahayog?""
Every time she belittles me, I become sad for a few days and then forget everything and try to become very good with her. But it continues every week or so. I am a very joyful guy. Everyone says so. But when my mother belittles me, I get deeply hurt. I get hurt so much that I can't sleep well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ao32wq/how_do_i_deal_with_my_mother_continuously/,2/11/2024 8:11,24,0,25,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,1,2

We saw some very thought provoking posts, we made random internet strangers' happiness OR sorrows, ours. The word that bound us invisibly, was the unfettered, unashamed ""togetherness"". r/Nepal isn't merely a community at this point: it's an idea, a movement for civilized discourse, and relishing the joys of touching lives without learning the strangers' names, their background, anything, at all. 

We were but a humbling 150k members not a year back, but that number's gone up to nearly 175k today. More folks are there to share the proverbial ""chiya adda guffs"" than ever. We hope that this invisible comradery, something ethereal that binds all of us in the coming days as well.

Looking back, in our eyes every post created in r/Nepal was a creative endeavor, every thought that was but a small spark in all of our heads, that materialized into something sublime. In case you missed, here are some of the most memorable posts r/Nepal has seen in 2024, as well as the faceless individuals that brought them forth to us all:

* [I recreated Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha) in Minecraft!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1drhlac/i_recreated_mt_everest_sagarmatha_in_minecraft/), an effort of creativity that transcends words, by u/Amon6669
* [We Nepalese lack civic sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1e95elv/we_nepalese_lack_civic_sense/), a thought provoking political discussion started by u/Ok-Lengthiness3565
* [The irony of nepali drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fovmgl/the_irony_of_nepali_drivers/), a veiled irony ""truck sahitya"" by u/reddit_manish2003

We'll be rewarding these posts with a spick and span ""Best of '24 flair"" gold flair to commemorate when they brought our community together to celebrate creativity, light-hearted discussions, or even common woes shared by all within our community, and our country.

1b4m3cn,Sports can unite people like nothing else,"It was really important match against a very strong Netherlands side today. The fact that Nepal managed to clinch the game from jaws of defeat yesterday, and combining that it was Saturday, Kirtipur ground was at its full capacity. Crowd was going bonkers every balls. Absolute madness. 

Today, cricket offered the platform for all Nepalese to transcend boundaries of Caste, Race, Ethnicity and common stereotypes, and find common ground in all of us. There was no Mongols, Baun/Chhetris, or Pahadi or Madhesis. Through Cricket, we all found common ground, celebrated shared achievement (Nepal's victory), and forged connections that strengthens the fabric of our society. 

A joy to behold. This is exactly what we need to do. We all need to keep nation's best interest at heart, and find that common ground and work on bridging divides, breaking down barriers, and build connections based on mutual respect, empathy, compassion and most important of all,  inclusiveness. And, show our collective middle fingers to these naysayers.

pq2neo,"people who deleted their reddit account, did you later regret it?","this is going to be the cheesiest thing i have ever posted, so bare with me. i saw someone say a popular guy from this sub wanted to leave for a long time and finally left after a certain incident. i have been thinking of getting out for quite some time too. i feel like im wasting a lot of my time commenting bs on random people's post for a couple upvotes. its been going on for the last six months. Everyday i wake up and the first thing i do is check my phone for reddit notifications and start refreshing the feed every half an hour to see if anyone has posted anything for me to comment something funny on.

i first joined reddit back in 2019 after years of hearing so much about it, but id stumble upon the site every now and then though, looking for different videogame lore, game of thrones, anime who 'would win between two', tinder+dates+in+nepal+reddit, nepali+hookup+stories, you know, the usual stuffs. i also remember watching porn on reddit back in 2014, i had no idea what the site was about and thought it was as a cheap homemade porn site. fast forward to 2019, i had an account from my real name and would look for random things and crypto mining and gpu price fall and stuffs but what really got me into the Nepali reddit scene was the wallstreetbets incident, i wondered if Nepal had a similar subreddit so i looked for it and joined the sub hoping id make a few thousand rupees, i had just started filling in ipos at that time. But since i was the only guy with a real name, i decided to delete my old account and make a new one, and what better way to name your account than Baldur, the Norse god of light, joy, purity, immortality, and a bunch of other stuffs. but actually i named it after Baldur from the God of War 2018. ps it was sometime around this month i found out i spelled imortal wrong in my username.

since there was a subreddit dedicated to Nepali stock market, i knew there had to be a similar sub for everyday nepali people. so i typed Nepal on the search tab and joined r/nepal. obviously i dint start shitposting immediately, there was a huge discussion going on when at that time, some guy from Kavre had killed a dog for biting his kid or something, there had been a huge debate on that, half attacked the guy for killing the dog mercilessly, and the other half including myself gave him the benefit of the doubt saying the guy had his reasons for killing the dog and that stray dogs really are a problem, i personally have been chased by stray dogs on my motorcycles multiple times at dark, so i obviously i didnt attack the guy blindly. a few days after that, a girls only school got exposed for inappropriately touching their students or slut shaming them and being homophobic to the girls, i dont remember it very clearly, it was six months back i think.

so after couple days when the situation cooled down a bit, a few guys started communist propaganda on the sub and i got into discussions with them. it took a toll on me ngl lol. so i decided not to post anything serious and only shitpost, so shitpost i did, some were great, some were cringeworthy, but they got me through my toughest days, not the post and comments but the upvotes and the occasional awards i got.

one  of the reasons i joined and stayed around for so long and post almost on a daily basis was to get a taste of social life which i had been missing due to my personal problems, but dont get me wrong, im not an incel lol and i have friends, it might come as a surprise but im also a very good looking guy without any face acne, its just that im going through a tough time right now, which the constant reddit browsing is not helping me get any better. i know its not been very long especially when compared to the ogs , but still the daily four hours or so of reddit is taking a toll on me, and the only way i see to stop myself from using it is by deleting my account, that or get my shit together and just stop using it and not look back because i also dont want to loose everything that i have posted over the months.

so i want to ask the guys who deleted their main account or their most used alts, did yall regret later?

also if i do delete my account or just stop using it, i want to name a few of my favorite users from this sub. boksi\_fucker69, naty\_dreadlocks, chaoticThundergod, narcius, qkathmandu, difrpodcasat.  honorable mentions: zkathmandu, lava-bath,  Fun\_uaguar1168

i know most of you dont even know who i am, to those people i promise you, youre not missing anything, to those who hold a grudge against me because once i didnt agree with your point of view, lets end it on a good note, and to those who have been nice to me and helped me with different  things, thank you, but to those mofos who are going to say something stupid in the comments just to ruin my day a little more, fuck you, yeah i know i sound like a hypocrite when im saying this but ill take it. and i also dont want to sound like one of those attention seeking full of themselves teenagers who think the whole world revolves around them just because they exist, if im radiating a similar vibe, thats not me. i just wanted  to get some things off my chest thats all

Hello people of r/nepal.

So, the thing is my cousin brother who is currently residing in India is coming for a week visit to our home (Nepal). We have quite friendly relationship and often talk to each other. He comes here once or twice a year and we spend most of the time together during his stay.

Apparently, this time I'm out of ideas about how things to do - fun/recreational memorable activities. I genuinely want to make his stay a joyful time so I need your help and guidance from your experience regarding 'things/activities to do'.

11h31lc,WHY SSF(Social Security Fund)??,"So, picture this - I'm a fresh-faced 21-year-old still in college and my previous job forced me to stash some chunk of my hard-earned ""salary"" in SSF (didn't care about that until now - there's about 50k in there)

At first, I was like, ""Eh kei xaina, chaheko bela claim garaula ani sabai nikalaula"" Oh how wrong I was. Apparently, I can't touch that moolah until I hit the ripe old age of 60 :) . But wait, there's more! If I'm desperate for cash before then, I can always take out a loan from my own money...with interest. Joy.

So, I did some quick maths (not my strong suit, let's be real) and realized that even if I put the money in a fixed deposit for about 39 years (60 - 21 for people who are lost) assuming 10% interest compounded annually, I'd end up with around 18 to 20 lakhs. Um, I could have this? but SSF said ""No!""

But hey, let's not be all doom and gloom. Apparently, SSF does come with some perks...or so I've heard. I tried to do some research, but everything I found was more snooze-fest than fun-fest. So, WHY SSF?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/11h31lc/why_ssfsocial_security_fund/,3/3/2023 15:08,5,0,21,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,1,0,1,0,0
x8yuhx,"Grandfather passed away 2 weeks ago, girlfriend/fiance dumped me yesterday, how do I get back up?","It has been 15 days since my grandfather passed away.

And, yesterday morning, my girlfriend (25/F) who had agreed to marriage a month before in front of her parents said that she lost interest in me (27/M) and dumped me.

I feel depressed but I do not want to keep feeling this way since I do not have any control over what has happened in my life. These are all the things that I've tried:

* I tried talking with my parents but that isn't helping. I don't have any close friends to talk to about my personal life so here I am on Reddit seeking advice.
* Overeating helps but I have started to gain a lot of weight due to it which is making me more depressed day by day.  
* Although I used to be a workaholic and resorted to heavy loads of work in my past breakup, my passion for work has diminished since I already made a comfortable living. Work doesn't help anymore.
* I've tried playing DOTA but it has stopped serving as a method for escapism. My mind wanders a lot and I get no joy.
* I've tried working out but the feeling of immense sadness comes back when I get into the shower.
* I have no energy to go solo travel. The only place I can think of going is Pokhara but I've already gone there too many times to feel any excitement.

How do I get back up and start enjoying things again? I don't want to resort to alcohol or anything but that seems like the only escape at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/x8yuhx/grandfather_passed_away_2_weeks_ago/,9/8/2022 12:09,23,0,25,English,1,0,1,0,1,2
puhhz6,I don't want to feel suicidal.,"Hi. I am 30 years of age and almost everything is going a downward spiral. I just have a high school degree and stuck in a job which pays the bills. I want to make this decade better; maybe fall in love with someone, get a degree, and do something. I have thought of applying abroad but with a huge gap after high school, I don't stand a chance and I feel like out of the many checklists to be ticked off, I've failed in almost every point. I have been battling depression for a decade and have social anxiety too. I try to take one step at a time but fail continuously. I don't like the cold vibe I get from people around me and worse, I can't just go out. I often toy around with the idea of not existing, I don't want to kill myself but even the basic thing like breathing feels burdensome. I don't want to feel this. I want to feel joy. I want to travel somewhere.

I love jacaranda, but apart from that i adore white lilies!

Jacaranda reminds me how elegant he was. How he became my flower of healing. How he became my good luck and a way to get wisdom. How his soul liberated me. And white lilies, they remind me how pure he was and how he made me pure with his purity. They remind me how innocent he was and how he bloomed everything around us with his innocence. Both flowers remind me that we might not be together anymore but we will always bloom individually.

y0jz5w,First Day solo travel in Pokhara,"So, due to my friends cancelling their trip and me not being able to get a refund for my ticket, I came to Pokhara alone today. And here's a except of things I wrote down on my impromptu journal today if you are interested:

10AM
Landed in Pokhara and walking to Lakeside instead of taking a cab. Went to this nice restaurant and had breakfast. I am feeling an urge to strike a convo with strangers even though normally I wouldnt. Maybe its because i see so many solo tourists walking around in the streets. Makes me feel a bit more comfortable. Havent given into this urge yet. Maybe i should? 

12AM
After a lot of walking back and forth, saw a hotel with a garden. I know im not gonna spend time in the garden but for some reason I wanted to stay in a hotel with a garden. Lol. So, I got a room and checked in.

1PM
Hiked to this place called Methlang. It was raining and foggy but the walk was still fun. I was very very sweaty, so took the second shower of the day. Lol

3PM
Tried to look for some weed but no luck. Some guys did give me whispers on the streets. They said, 'smoke, bro?' But i ignored them because i thought id score some in methlang. But ohhh no, i tried to encounter the shady whisperers on my way back but no luck. It never happens when u are actively looking for it. Very strange.

4PM
Came back to hotel room. Felt tired after the hike. Also noticed some dark circles so decided to take a nap. Best fucking nap ever!

7PM
Got some coffee at Java with a Banana Muffin. The Muffin was so tasty! 😭 So softttt. Yummm! I thought about how I was craving conversation earlier. But, you know what, I dont really have the energy to talk to anyone. I thought that maybe I should go to Busy Bee or something to socialize a little. But I was craving naan so I googled places to eat naan. Decided to go busy bee after.

8PM
Ate very tasty naan and chicken tandoori for dinner accompanied by a bottle of Gorkha. The Naan was served with chicken tandoori. The naan was fuckin hugee. The place's name is Kabab King. Remember it! Although u have it written here so you won't really need to remember it. Lol. Also overheard some tourists talking there and they seemed to have a very positive view of Nepali people. I am very proud of my Nepali bretheren.

9PM
After dinner, I said 'fuck busy bee, I don't have the energy to go to a noisy bar'. So, I walked to the lake and just sat on a bench. I then closed my eyes and just reflected on things. It made me realize how much I've had bottled up in me, AGAIN! Its like my mind is blocking a lot of things. But, slowly but surely, I will deal with them.

10PM
Came back the hotel room. On my way here, I felt like dancing in the streets because the closed eye self reflection at the lake really set me loose. I was walking around with open arms and grooving with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard playing on my earbuds.

------------
I really miss my friends and wish they were here to share the joy I felt in the night. But, if they were here, i wouldn't have had these moments. Id probably be drinking at a loud ass bar or something. Oh well, you cant have everything I guess. Haha

------------
If any of you have suggestions for me on what I can do to spend time tomorrow, please let me know lol. Thinking of watching a movie tomorrow. If there's any other solo travelers in Pokhara reading this then I also don't mind meeting up. Even with the self reflection, it still feels a bit lonely. But, its ok to feel that way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/y0jz5w/first_day_solo_travel_in_pokhara/,10/10/2022 17:02,23,0,19,English,0,0,1,1,0,0

149wp19,What to do? Help,"(M 22 )I feel lost and confused. I'm doing things, but sometimes I question the things I am doing . I always had high hopes for myself, but it seems like I've failed. It's weighing heavily on my heart. I tried learning new skills, and that did help, but I've been struggling to socialize and share things with others. The only people I know are acquaintances from college. To be honest I dont have any friends with whom  I can just chill , share ,call without any second thought. I lost many old friends because I didn't  talk to them when I was more insecure before nor they reached out to me. Now I've tried reaching out to them a little, but it seems like it's too late, and also they haven't shown any interest in reconnecting either.

 Not having genuine friends to experience joy, learn, grow, and share the randomest experiences  has left a big hole in my life. I often feel lonely, and it can be tough at times. If anyone else is going through something similar, I'd like to connect and start fresh. 

I'm sharing this on Reddit because maybe some of you are going through the same thing. Starting over without insecurities and judgment can be helpful. Maybe together we can pull off this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/149wp19/what_to_do_help/,6/15/2023 8:18,7,0,5,English,0,0,1,0,1,2

15wemak,Do you really support Nepali? Popularity Vs Underrated,"Do you really support Nepali? but who really? Just Popular ones? Viral? (Mainly Entertainment field)

I have seen lot of same comments on Youtube, as many Nepali people saying ''Let's support Nepali'', ''Nepali lai support nagareh kaslai garneh! lots of love'' and love emoji. How nice of them and people giving thumbs up and replying ''Ho! Ho Let's support Nepali!''

Wait! Have you noticed something? All those comments are actually on those Nepali videos (whether Nepali movie or song) which already have over 1,2  million views and getting more or even over 10 million views or those songs/videos which are getting very viral all over social media.

Why not such support on less known Nepali videos? So What about ''Let's Support Nepali'' on those Nepali videos which have far less views and you'd want them to be known more, whether by commentating or sharing or even by covering (It seems like most of those Nepali cover artist also cover popular songs only just to make their channel grow). Maybe I'm wrong but it seems like either Nepali just go for recent popular ones or the ones that were popular long time ago, they don't really dig to other stuff. There are now new songs, new artist, new bands have been coming but also vanishing (One of the main reason is there isn't support from Nepalese). Nowadays, One has to have One Hit Wonder or needs a Great luck! otherwise all these unknown artist and bands have to remain with under 10, 000 subscribers whereas mukbang Nepalese (example) who just eats in front of you has over 80, 000 subscribers. Insane!

This is not just regarding the Nepal song/artist or band. Even the new actors/actress/directors/ theatre actors not getting the actual support from Nepalese. Popular ones keep getting the project whereas the others keep struggling. Now I'm going to talk about particular field.

Anyway, last 15 years in Nepal, Popularity of Nepali rock has been declining year by year but it somehow also tries to reach the audiences but have failed to do, if compared to our own Lok Dohori, Nepali Movie Songs, and then Hiphop/Rap and the rise of Nepali Indie music have completely overshadowed Nepali Rock genre (except Nepali Metal has their own small fandom though but in their own world)

However, it's the Nepali rock that is not gaining well enough even in small country Nepal (when it had such an huge rock impact 20 years ago, I understand it's happening all over the world except Japan, Norway, and few). Hope rock genre will come back (just like vinyl, converse shoes)

From my extensive research, there are about 10 - 12 Nepali rock albums have been released each year since 2017 (but only about 2 or 3 are well known). As for now, Since it's 2023, Here's some list, hope there will be more albums release this year.

***Nepali rock albums Released in 2023*** (Jan to July), Hope you will check it out and comment which one you like (Not based on popularity but based on songs) (***Also just because it's rock, doesn't mean it's just loud, there are plenty of smooth, feel good rock songs with attractive melodies, meaningful lyrics, amazing music, etc as well in these albums)***

In your presence dear, I have discovered a love so profound that it surpasses my own desires. I have witnessed the sparkle in your eyes and the joy on your face when you're with him. It is in those moments that I realize that he can offer you a happiness I may not be able to provide.

It takes strength to step aside, to acknowledge that someone else can make you happier than I ever could. But love is not about possession; it is about wanting the best for the person we hold dear. And if letting you go means seeing you smile and flourish in the arms of another, then I will find the strength within me to do so.

Know that my love for you will remain, even as we walk separate paths. I will always cherish the memories we shared and the love we once held. Though it hurts, I will stand by your side as a friend, offering support and cheering for your happiness.

May life bless you with endless joy and may the love you find with him be everything you've ever dreamed of. Remember, my heart will forever hold a special place for you, even as we part way",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/14efyle/at_the_end/,6/20/2023 16:38,6,0,1,English,0,0,1,0,0,2

xe83ds,Appreciation post,"Just Today in middle of a chaos of hectic duty with overflowing patients... 3 visitors came to the emergency department in our hospital where i work... 
Seeing their face i recall that i have interacted with them in some way. And couldn't quite remember exactly where and when.. But they approached me with a bright smile and joy on their face.
What astonished me was one of them stretched his arms forward with a box of laddu in his hand. And offered to feed me one laddu from his own hand as gesture of gratitude and gave the box as well to distribute to others, cause he had gotten all better after about 1 week of hospital stay.
The surprising thing for me was i was not the one who took care of him are prescribed his daily medications. 
I'm sure as an emergency doctor i had only given symptomatic management as usual. Sad thing is that i don't fully remember the case but he was a case of poisoning and on arriving to ER he was unconscious. The only part i did different was talking properly to them and addressing how he was doing and giving proper updates about reports even though 2 3 Dr have to take care of around 25-28 patients at a time... With new patients arriving every now and then.. 
This just showed me how good words and a concern goes a long way. And felt like we should appreciate people more.. be kind towards everyone.. speak softly and politely even though we have lot of pressure and stress in our work and life.. Kinda made my day. Just felt like sharing it

No offence and please me mindful and thoughtful about the post !

While the kind of  immense wealth that can buy mansions and sports cars might not be the goal for some, money unquestionably gives you more freedom. Having enough money can mean being able to live where you want, eat what you want and travel when you want.

Money provides flexibility and options.

But, as these results show, money also isn’t everything. It can’t foster friendships or restore joy.

Growing your own food is a *lifestyle*. Which means that you will probably have to make some priority changes to be successful at growing your own food. Along with dedication, there were also some realizations along the way that have made it possible for us to grow a large amount of our own food on such a small homestead.

So, yes, we ditched our ""city"" life and started living a quiet and more meaningful life:

""You will harvest what you have sown""

Harvest the sense of peace, joy and passion with [Hike and Trek](http://hikeandtrek.com/)!

For Nepalese farmers, Asar 15 (June 29) —also known as National Paddy Day—holds special meaning because it signifies the start of paddy planting just after the country's monsoon season.

  
The majority of farmers celebrate the day by planting rice seedlings in the field today. On this day, people go to the paddy field, where they dance and fling mud at one another. Another common style of singing is Asare Bhaaka. This single-day plantation festival marked the start of plantation season across the nation. On this day, people perform traditional folk songs, splash each other with muddy water, and plant rice saplings in the fields. Dahi Chiura Khane Din, commonly known as curd and beaten rice, is a traditional dish that must be consumed every day.

tumkwg,12 common myths encountered while trekking in Nepal," After this pandemic outbreak, people get aware of the importance and benefit of trekking. Many people love trekking worldwide, or they might be planning to do it. A hiker or backpacker needs to know many things, always learning.  
   
A trip to Nepal is an adventure, then trekking in Nepal is the answer. Because trekking in Nepal offers you the highest peaks, lush jungles, excellent trails, cultures, countless natural, most beautiful, and untouched places, along with a unique experience of Asia, It will give you an immense opportunity to interact with people of different areas.  
   
Here's what you all trekkers need to know about these 12 myths we've heard. They include what longtime hikers are doing wrong and what you should instead be doing. Maybe it can guide you!  
   


### 1. Trekking and Hiking in Nepal is just walking

Many people take hiking as an interchangeably a day walk. That could take just one hour, or the hike might take more than hours. However, walking 24 hours isn't necessarily correct. Most of the Trek comprises high mountains, steep trails, and beautiful waterfalls.  


Thus, while choosing a trekking destination, search for a walk with a solid cultural component or where you can become a part of adventurous activities. It will help you to forget not only pain but also help you to explore culture, views, and languages.  
   


### 2. You need to be a super fit and thin

While trekking in Nepal might be very physically demanding, saying you have to be a super fit for the trek will be wrong. For overweight people who still want to hike, getting rid of those stereotypes is the first step. Trekking improves a person's health in a significant way.  


You'll have more fun, prevent injuries, and have a better experience if you climb around boulders, rock hop, and ascend hills on the trail for several hours. It will improve your experience, prevent injury, and make it easier. So if you are planning for the trek, then get away from all the wrong assumptions that thin people only do hiking.   


### 3. During winter, I don't need many layers because I am used to the cold

There is a common myth about trekking in Nepal Himalayas: one jacket will be enough during winter. You will feel colder than layering, no matter how thick your coat is.  


There must be a reason why layering is more critical and more effective. When you wear 2 to 3 layers of the jacket, there will be air gaps between the jackets. The air space between the body and the garment helps you keep warm. The layering of fabrics in the garment improves thermal insulation.  


So make sure, while trekking, you must wear at least 4-5 warm layers so that you can tackle temperatures below -10 degrees. So, one thick jacket is less effective than a two or three-layer jacket.  


### 4. Huge cultural and religious differences between Nepalese people and western trekkers

Most trekkers love to trek to see culture, people, and language. Thus, it is wrong to say that people involved in tourism do not respect your religious and cultural identity.  


Many temples, monasteries, and churches are abundantly found in Nepal. There is no restriction to people. Thus it's up to you to visit those places or not. Similarly, during the trek, eating together, talking, handshaking, entering a home is not that big taboo anymore in town and city.  


### 5. Alcohol keeps you warm

Drinking alcohol will keep your body warm, while trekking is one of the most famous myths, among others. However, the assumption of alcohol may make you feel warm because it causes blood to rush to your skin's surface.  


However, the truth is when you drink alcohol, it causes your blood vessels to widen and makes you lose heat faster. Some research also shows that drinking alcohol in the cold decreases your core body temperature, which is a terrible thing at high altitudes during wintertime. So think before consuming alcohol while trekking.  


### 6. Carrying a first aid kit is all set for curing common medical issues

If you are a beginner, you might probably hear about the first aid kit. You might also have thought that having a first aid kit in our packs, you're set if something happens.  


Right?! Yes, it will benefit you with many injuries if only you have wilderness first aid knowledge. Only carrying first aid will not help. You need to know what's in your kit and have a sense of when and how you'd use each of the items.  


So, before packing for the trek, learn about a wound before you bandage it up? How do you tie an ace wrap effectively, so it doesn't cut off blood flow but still supports an injury?  
   


###  7. Waterproof boots will keep your feet dry

During winter, the trails are mostly covered with snow. As you go through the water crossing and water does get inside your shoe, your shoes will stay wet for quite a while.  


That makes your feet more prone to blisters and even fungus infections. So, wearing a waterproof boot will help your feet dry. However, there are some merits to this, but when your feet are covered with waterproof boots long time.  


That keeps moisture in, and your feet spend all day sweating; they won't correctly air out. Thus, as a result, it makes them more prone to blisters.  


### 8. You'll get eaten by a wild animal

This one myth is a common one in Nepal. As we know, Nepal is famous for its Himalayas, mountains, and natural beauty. While trekking in these mountains, the fear of mountain bears and lions is quite understandable. But there are some things that you can do when you encounter wild animals.  


Many studies prove that a bee is more likely to be killed than a bear. The odd of being attacked by a bear are 1 in 2.1 million. So be careful and choose a safe trek.   


### 9. Terrible tea-houses and infrastructures in Mountain of Nepal

It is another common myth that relates to the trek of Nepal. While trekking, you will encounter countable tea-houses in the upper trekking region. Where you can get enough tea and launch, it's wrong to say that the tea houses of Nepal are terrible.  


Talking about mountain regions, you might have some difficulties getting these luxuries as the transportation of these regions is not well developed. So, the myth might be familiar because the extra you get in the lower trekking region does not match the upper trekking region. Food menu, chocolate bars, drinks might be more expensive in this region.  
   


### 10. At higher attitude, its snowy

Another common myth about trekking in Nepal is that it snows all-time at high altitudes during winter. However, the truth is that it does not snow every time in winter. Many people love to see snowfall, so feel lucky when you see it. You can also experience warm sun with a melting snow view during this time.   


When the sun hits those snow-covered mountains, it shines like silver. Viewers and hikers can encounter those views in their lifetime. Thus, it is wrong to say that it snows at a higher altitude every time.  
   


### 11. Trekking is only for young people

Generally, trekking regularly helps in lowering blood pressure and many other diseases. Some studies also show that trekking also reduces the risk of diabetes and heart disease. However, to do trekking might need physical abilities or stamina.  


In reality, age is just a number that will never bring to an end you from trekking. Everybody has access to trouble-free hiking and trekking destinations. Trekking and hiking are not races; you can go at your own pace and enjoy the surrounding scenery.  


The joy of walking in its beauty is impressive that any age can enjoy. So, don't let your golden age stay you from this breathtaking escapade.   
   


### 12. Booking through a trekking agency is pricey

As of today, there are lots of trekking agencies in Nepal. So, booking a ticket and permits through a trekking agency will be easier and might be expensive. However, there is some agency where a booking is not that must be costly.  


Similarly, you can negotiate with an agency for the price and services with an organization provider. Hence, be extra considerate with agencies while arguing to give extra-ordinary services at a not so high price. Yes, nothing is free of charge. To make light of the cost, you can use the following few tricks,  


a. Making the trekking group size as large as possible.  
b. Booking medium-priced hotel over five-star hotel  
c. Choose less crowded trekking region  
d. Explore the discount system of Nepal  
e. Use a local organizer if possible

oknncc,Have you ever feel you are the reason your family can never be happy?,"I saw a pair of eyes and a face today which made me spit myself in my mouth. of course they were of my fathers. after all, what is there for him to feel happy or proud about me?

So I'm a 24 year old boy who finished (well not really) his engineering education 2 years back. Although I was pretty good in my school (A government school in a remote village in a rural district), I really couldn't perform very well in my +2 and Engineering resulting 14 backs in 4 years, of which some would hunt me to this day. Among 14, I've eventually passed 11 of them but the remaining three, the three ones I failed in my Third semester, I failed one more time few days back. It's been 6 times I've given the exams of those subjects and yet, I've never passed any one of them. It's not like I don't study at all also, I study a fair amount and still those three subjects, I never pass. As the result of my last exams got announced a few days back, my father asked me yesterday about the results and I couldn't lie to him. It turned him very sad immediately and since then, he hasn't talked to me. This morning I saw him, tho he is mostly sad and grumpy, I've never seen him that sad and my mother informed me how he didn't sleep last night and was murmuring ""paar ta lagauana nasakne raxa kailei"". I feel extremely sad and guilty and feel that the reason for this family not being happy and in peace is only me. I know I'm gonna study again, give the exams and try to pass again but what if I fail another time? It will be 7th time I'll be giving those exams. What if I never finish my engineering? My father has a dream, he wants me to go to abroad, some first world country where many of his friends/relatives's children are. He has a dream that I earn so much that the financial struggles he and his family faced, I would not face.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/oknncc/have_you_ever_feel_you_are_the_reason_your_family/,7/15/2021 7:14,136,0,72,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,0,1,0,1,2

1hp1me1,Happy Tamu Lhosar (And some info on other types of Lhosar),"It's hard to predict Lhosars on the International Calendar (Solar) or the Nepali Calendar (Luni-Solar). That's because Lhosar follows the Tibetan Calendar, which is a Lunar Calendar.  

There are three kinds of Lhosar: 

1. Gyalpo Lhosar

It's celebrated in the cities. This one is the real Lhosar, celebrated on the first day of the first month. 

2. Sonam Lhosar

It's celebrated in villages, where farmers live. In Tibetan, farmers are called ""sonampa"". This one is celebrated on the first day of the 12th month. Don't ask me why.  This Lhosar is celebrated in Bhutan and in Nepal. Also in India. 

3. Tol Lhosar/Purang Lhosar/Lhadakh Lhosar/Tamu Lhosar

I think Tamu Lhosar has a different origin from the other Lhosars, but they are celebrated around the same dates. But people usually consider this ""Tol Lhosar"" to be the real Lhosar. It's celebrated on the first day of the 11th month, and always hits one to two days around the International New Year.

o0530b,Happy Pride r/Nepal! A post for our straight friends:,"Heyyo friendos! Happy Pride Month! We are almost 60k members in the sub now and I thought I'd post something for those of us who aren't exactly sure what Pride is about, and would perhaps like to learn :) I have also added a section on some things lgbt people would like our straight friends to know.

*A. A bit on Sexuality*

There are essentially just three terms you need to know to understand the whole thing.

i. Sex: This is what is between your legs. It can be male, female, or sometimes an anatomical mix of the two, called Intersex.

ii. Gender: This is what is in your mind. What one *feels* like. It can again be male, female, or non-binary (that is, when people don't feel like either a man or a woman)

iii. Sexual orientation: Who you want to have sex with.

For most of us, the three of these are pretty neatly lined up. You are born with balls, you feel like a dude, and you want to sleep with women. 
But for up to 10% of the population, that isnt the case. For instance, I was born male, totally feel like a guy, but find other guys cute and don't want to do women. That makes me gay.

Some people are born with ovaries but always feel like a man. This makes them transgender men, for example.

But things aren't always so simple. For instance, some people are born with testicles... but have a vagina... and feel like a shapeless blob and would be okay sleeping with anyone as long as they are emotionally in love first... making them intersex-agender-demi-pansexual. 

The point is, these words and labels are something we use to identify ourselves better and find people like us, but don't necessarily represent the whole spectrum. So you don't need to know all the letters of lgbtqia+ and their meanings, unless you really want to understand someone else's, or your own sexuality. Considering almost 1 in 10 fall in the queer (aka lgbtqia) spectrum, who knows, you might find something that describes you too :)

*B. Why pride?*

Loving oneself is hard is general, but it becomes exponentially harder when your community has been told for centuries that you are diseased, you are going to hell, and you are lesser than those around you. Plus we're always kinda scared our family and friends might abdandon us when they find out :/ Pride is a therefore a reminder of sorts that there is nothing inherently wrong with us, there is a global supportive community, and we don't always have to hide.

*C. What your LGBT friends would like you to know/do:*

1. Please treat lgbti people the way you treat other people in your lives. That is all we really need from you tbh, and doing this alone will make you better than 90% of the population out there.

2. Understand that there are lgbti people ALL around you. When I first started to talk to fellow queer people, I learned that 3 of my seniors in (a pretty small) college, 2 batchmates, several juniors, a professor, and a guy I sat next to for 2 years in +2 were gay. Maybe someone in your immediate friend circle, maybe your cousin, maybe your brother is gay as well. We don't always come in shiny flamboyant packages, and you can't really tell someone is gay by just looking at them.

So when you use slurs like ""chhakka"", or the word gay as an insult/something lame, you might be hurting someone very close to you without knowing. We laugh along when our friends make these insensitive jokes, but knowing that is how our friends see queer people pushes us further into our closet every time.

3. Understand that someone being gay doesn't mean they are automatically attracted to you. We have a whole sea of gorgeous fish available, and we really like to focus our energy on that, and not on straight men as far as possible. I'm saying this becuase a lot of popular media portrays gay people as some sort of sexual predators pining over the straight protagonist and many of our male friends are uncomfortable being in the presence of someone gay. There is no reason to be, and usually we are trying our best to make sure you don't get the wrong message.

4. If someone ever comes out to you, it would be the absolute best if you could just treat them the way you treated them previously, and let them know that nothing will change.

So... I'll shut up now haha. If there is anything you are curious about, please feel free to ama, and I'll try to be as honest as possible. Or I might do a separate ama post if that becomes necessary. 

Thanks for reading till the end! You're amazing for wanting to learn more :D

tldr: There are queer people all around you. Treat them, and everyone else, the way you like to be treated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/o0530b/happy_pride_rnepal_a_post_for_our_straight_friends/,6/15/2021 3:55,115,0,73,English,1,0,1,1,0,1

 Sitting at the table, and looking outside with headset strapped on head or listening birds chatting outside  is becoming my favorite thing to do now-a-days.

x4927r,Happiness lasts too short.,Today we got our +2 results. I was certain that I would fail in maths but somehow I passed and even got fairly good marks. My girlfriend also got around same marks as mine and i was happy for both of us (Both were hopeless before results). But then she broke up with me. I was having some family issues and I snapped on her few days ago which I am so ashamed of (jhagada matrai ho vako mukh ni chadeko thena )and she didn't speak with me for 2 days. I tried to apologize but she didn't respond and today she finally spoke with me I asked her about her results and after that she said she was fed up with me and didn't want to be together anymore. She wasn't like this before and it's not like that I get angry with her on daily basis. Now I don't know what to do or how to respond. Everyone says move on but it's been 4 year since we've been really close and in relationship.

The guy as he walked looked at people around him and realized everyone had different expressions. He saw wide variety of people of different age groups. Some funky ass college students cracking jokes and laughing at each others similarly some students walking alone seemingly worried. 
An old woman selling poleko makai (sorry for the vocabs) looking at people around her and expecting them to buy and help her. 
Not to make it long and boring, meanwhile small kids of around 8-9 unaware of what their lifes gonna be are happy with what they have. Four kids with one jumbo dew bottle half filled with some kind of juice, they are happy in their own world. 
The guy questioned himself what is the point of life. Why are the people rushing and for what? What is happiness? Can earning enough money for basic needs bring happiness? Why cant we be happy like those small child? Why does even a small thing can bring smile to a kids face but not to some grown ups?

194mnub,"Life sure is a weird journey where one can be happy with nothing, others struggle with everything","The human experience is one hell of a weird experience. We are born into this world and put to the test from the beginning. It is good if you are born into a good family. If not, life is not going to be fun. 

My life has never been a difficult one. In fact, it is very average except that I got heavily molested by someone close to me at a young age and it changed everything for me. I guess that is also why I was motivated from a young age to do something or be someone. 

I am scared of a lot of things in life. One of them is that I won’t amount to anything. That’s not true. If there is anything I am sure of in life, it is that I will be well-educated and have a great job sometime in the future. I am currently double majoring in aerospace and mechanical engineering. Things are going well because I have always known what to do in academics. Of course, I worry a lot but I know things will turn out well in the end. Yet, I am afraid. A good career and education can guarantee prestige and money but it cannot guarantee happiness. 

I feel like I have not achieved much in my life but that is a lie too. There are some things I am proud of. Like how I have never asked my parents for anything. I have never had to receive tuition or any help. My parents never had to worry about my studies nor had to spend much on it. In fact, I worked as a part-time tutor and earned quite a bit of money. I grew up in a very middle-class family who did not struggle to make a living but also did not experience any luxury. I did not know eating out was a thing until I graduated from grade 10. I have never taken money for granted. I am careful with it. Even now, I am on track to take complete care of myself emotionally, physically, and financially at the age of 19. Yet, it feels hollow. It is something to be proud of but I have rationalized my emotions to the point it feels pointless if I do not achieve that but doesn’t feel accomplished when I do achieve it.  

I thought money would solve my problems but that's far from the truth. I have realized money is a means of gaining happiness but it will never make you happy. I struggle with being content. I beat myself over not doing enough or being enough. No matter how good I am, it is never enough. I do not feel good about achieving good grades. It feels normal. I do not feel good that I am independent at 19. It feels normal. I worry that I will have money, prestige, and power but I won’t have happiness, love, or the feeling of being content. It is an uncomfortable, heavy feeling. I can navigate everything in life but I do not know how to navigate not feeling like I am enough. It isn’t like that affects me actively. I do great in my daily life. Good friend circle, good studies, good most things except I struggle to sleep at times. It feels heavy because I am constantly not doing anything. I don't even know what the real issue is anymore. I wonder how people live such long lives. I am going through a mid-life crisis in my twenties.

ivs5t4,How the heck do you guys manage to stay happy these days?,"Everyone's so busy with their phones and laptops these days. I try to spend time with my family and cousins but everyone's too busy. I spend my days listening to 00s songs reminiscing the good ol' days. Things were much better when not everyone had phones, at least not smartphones. I'm standing at the bus stop and literally everyone's bowing to their phones. Come on, look around. I call my friends to meet but they have to ""finish this season they're watching, and it's so good I should watch it too."" I miss the old days when things were physical, not virtual. Facebook's motto was to ""connect the world"". So where's the connection? It's been months since someone even said ""Hello"" to me. Somehow texting someone miles away who isn't even online is more important than talking to someone who's sitting right next to you and is actually trying to say something. People used to text me once in a blue moon when I had social media accounts, but ever since I deleted them and told people close to me to actually call me when they wanna talk, no one's bothered. I try to call them and they won't pick up. This is all depressing af. And people complain about more and more people getting depressed these days. What else do you expect with an environment like this? Heck, even I feel like I'm depressed. Even most of our ""old fashioned"" parents are so into Facebook these days, it's scary.

zo3x4b,feeling sad and happy at same time,"Today was a tough day. I'm still trying to adjust to living in Kathmandu and it's been harder than I thought it would be. I miss my family and friends back home so much and it's hard not to feel lonely here.

I tried to stay busy today and went out to explore the city a bit. I visited Durbar Square and was blown away by the stunning architecture and rich history of the area. I also went to Boudhanath Stupa, which was a peaceful and serene place. It was nice to get out of my apartment and see some new sights, but I couldn't shake the feeling of homesickness.

I'm trying to stay positive and remind myself that this is an opportunity to grow and experience new things, but it's hard not to feel sad sometimes. I'm hoping that as I get more comfortable here and make some new friends, the homesickness will start to fade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/zo3x4b/feeling_sad_and_happy_at_same_time/,12/17/2022 10:55,25,0,5,English,1,0,1,1,1,2

emos9y,Social Security Fund (सामाजिक सुरक्षा कोष) in Nepal. How happy are you?,"Hi Everyone, 

Greetings! Just wanted to post and know the views regarding Social Security Fund (सामाजिक सुरक्षा कोष) in Nepal. This post is only relevant if you are working and your company recently started using SSF cause it's mandatory from Govt. 

Those who do not know what SSF is, it's actually a fund created by Govt instead of PF(Provident Fund) where around 31% of salary will is taken by Govt and they will keep the money till you reach 60 years (yes, you won't be able to touch the money if you leave your job/unemployed too). After 60 yers, they will pay you as pension per month. (not as a whole amount too). Is our Government that capable? Do we trust our Government? This clearly looks like Govt is using our money and we can't do anything about it. 

As per Kathmandu Post ""*Nepal has a history of making a mockery of every good intent. The opacity of the Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund showed how the management, systems and processes of government funds lack transparency. When the Bonus Act led to banks paying out large bonuses, the government mandated that the excess amount must be deposited to a National Level Welfare Fund whose scope of activity is unknown. Therefore, the government does not have the credibility to be able to win the confidence of employers and employees that it will not siphon off money from the Social Security Fund.""*

Also, I read an interesting post from site called Merolagani. The site raised very good questions which are as follows:

 *1. नेपालमा धेरै कामदारहरूले बीचैमा काम छाडेर बेरोजगार रहने वा ससाना व्यवसाय गर्न थाल्छन्, उनीहरूले कामै छाडेर निस्केपछि पनि कोषमा सञ्चित रकम निकाल्न किन नपाउने ? कामदारलाई आज छाक टार्ने गर्जो छ भने ‘हैन तिमीलाई ६० वर्षपछिलाई पैसा चाहिन्छ, त्यसैले अहिले बरू भोकै बस’ भन्ने राज्य को हाे ?*

*2.कोषमा रहेको आफैंले जम्मा गरेको रकम कर्मचारी संचय कोषबाट झैं सहुलियतपूर्ण ऋण लिन पनि किन नपाइने?*

*3. अहिलेको व्यवस्था अनुसार योगदानकर्ताले योगदान गर्ने बेला ३६ प्रतिशतसम्म आयकर तिर्ने अनि निकाल्ने बेला पनि अर्को १५ प्रतिशत कर तिर्ने स्थिति छ । ज्ञवालीका अनुसार यो विषय अर्थ मन्त्रालयमा पुगेर निर्णय हुने क्रममा छ । कहिले र कस्तो निर्णय होला भविष्यले देखाउला । तर यति आधारभुत कुरा पनि कोष डिजाइन गर्ने बेला कसरी बेवास्ता गरियो? सरोकारवालाहरूले यो कुरा उठाएपछि अझैसम्म यसमा किन निर्णय भएको छैन?*

*4. अहिले सरकारले नै चलाएको स्वास्थ्य बीमा कार्यक्रममा वार्षिक रू ३५०० तिरेर परिवारका पाँज जना सदस्यको रू १ लाखसम्मको बीमा हुन्छ । यस विषयमा मैले हिसाब गरे अनुसार सामाजिक सुरक्षा कोष अन्तर्गतको स्वास्थ्य बीमाको प्रिमियम धेरै छ र लाभग्राही पनि कामदार आफैंबाहेक कोही हुन सक्दैन ।*

**So seems like most of the people who know about SSF are not totally happy. Why are people not doing anything? Isn't this a critical issue?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/emos9y/social_security_fund_समजक_सरकष_कष_in_nepal_how/,1/10/2020 9:45,13,0,28,English and Nepali,1,1,1,0,0,2

11wg972,Nepal ko placement in World Happiness index,"Today, 20th of march is the International day of Happiness, it is the day when the world happiness report is [released](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/#appendices-and-data).

Nepal is 78th on the happiness index and 119th in happiness gap (between top and the bottom half). Nepal being 78th is not surprising, as we are not even counted as developing countries (we are classified as least developed country, but we are graduating soon to devloping country soon [apparently](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/least-developed-countries)).

GDP, social support, health life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, generousity, perception of corruption, and dystopia are the categories happiness score is based on and it's not hard to imagine why Nepal is 78th in the list.

Tara achamma ko kura chai, Nepal being one of the newest and (arguably) successiful socio-democratic (kinda-communistic) loktantrik ganatantra \[there are not many that have worked, there are few functional socio-democratic society in the nordics\], we are quite bad in happiness gap. 119th. If I understand the report correctly the it's happiness gap between the top half and bottom half and it's piss poor in Nepal.

Dear friends and family,

I'm reaching out with a heavy heart to share that my 47-year-old mother is bravely fighting Nasopharyngeal Cancer. It's a tough battle, and as a single parent, she's been my rock since my dad passed away.  
We're facing not only the emotional strain but also the financial burden of medical expenses. Your support can make a huge difference. No contribution is too small.

Your generosity means the world to us and will help my mom in this challenging journey. Thank you for your kindness and support.""

Any amount of money for the help is appreciated!  Please share and help to save somebody's life. Thank you!

Edit: Updated esewa ID  
Previous account was limited  
Thanks for all your love and support!

Edit 2: A huge update!

A huge thanks to the Reddit and Discord community members who have helped me with the funds and prayed for the betterment of my mom's health. My heart wants to meet all these people in real life and thank them so much for helping me without even knowing me. 

I had zero hopes when I had no money and a mother lying in bed with cancer. Thanks to you all, I have gathered some funds to help my mother, and so far, I have collected **2,57,000** through your love and support. However, My doctor has said it's going to cost more, but I know I will be able to make it through and see my mother all happy and healthy. I hope your beautiful soul will keep helping me to collect more funds and share them with every community you know. Even a rupee is so valuable for me at the moment that any amount of money is a blessing for me!  
My mother also thanks all of the people for helping out. I know when she will be healthy she will be reading out all of these comments and cry out of happiness. Love you all!  
I hope the mods of this community will pin my post so more people will be able to help me out!

o0rzxp,Happy Pride r/Nepal! A post for our LGBTQ++ friends:,"Hola Amigos, Happy Pride Month! I thought I’d post something for those who routinely get called homophobic or disagree with the wild definition of gender /sex; I have also added a section on some things straight people would like our LGBTQ to know.  
Let's take a history lesson on Sexuality*  There are essentially just three terms you need to know to understand the whole thing.  
It’s almost as though the definitions of words have no meaning; all that matters is fealty to whatever narrative the chosen moral caste dictates on a daily basis. And if you cross it, you’re doing violence.

i. Sex: Defining ""sex"" as its actual definition does not ""erase"" anyone. Transgender people still exist. Nobody argues otherwise. But their existence does not mean society should identify them as members of the opposite biological sex.


ii. Gender: Gender isn't something that in your mind. Instead, it's male or female, No sentient human being with a function prefrontal lobe would acknowledge man can change their gender or Vice versa, and there is no scientific evidence to support that. The proper definition of gender is either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female.

iii. Sexual orientation:  sexual orientation and gender identity are not malleable...  Some argue intersex. Some unfortunate people are born with sexual organs from both sexes or sexual organs not developed. This is a REAL physical condition; it is not a question of what they think or feel. It is not under anyone's control. Some of them are what's called hermaphrodites

*A. Why pride?*  
Pride is celebrated by the lgbt members, which they have every right to do so! The problem is that when they try to cram down pride to different Individuals, even they don't want to participate or are too afraid to get called a homophobic 
You can celebrate whatever you chose to, but don't force it on others 

 *B What your Straight friends would like you to know/do:* 

 1.Everyone should treat everyone with the utmost respect no matter race, sex, or age.  

2. You can’t magically change your gender. You can’t magically change your sex. You can’t magically change your age.
 
 3. Understand that labeling  someone who disagrees with you doesn't help your cause; instead, it deters them from it same goes for calling someone a. homophobic 

 4. If someone ever comes out to you, it would be the absolute best if you could treat them the way you treated them previously” as previously stated, you should treat everyone with respect 

5. Understand that kids shouldn't have a   right to change his / her gender at a young age 

6. Understand that you can't use the science card when convenient for your argument, then disregard it when it's not. There are no credible scientific studies to ascertain these Obscene claims like swapping genders 

7. Advocating for the rights of the transgender community"" is a way to describe ""advocating for the unfettered ability to prescribe life-altering hormones and surgery to minors incapable of consent based on unproven hypotheses

8.  non-binary is male or female 

9. Attempts to force biological girls to play against biological boys are unconscionable attacks on biological girls and doesn't address the real problem

So let me start by saying this post isn’t directed towards anyone, and in no way I'm suggesting anyone should get hate. Also, 
this just a rebuttal to an idea. Many agree with me but are too afraid  to speak up many would rather instead virtue single than speak up 
As a society, we have gone so num to basic biology. When we try to point out basic biology. We get labeled as homophobic or as part of an alt-right. Reddit is a place where you are hailed as Savior of the republic if you speak the left language, if there any dissent, you automatically get labeled or even get called a Bigot even tho what you are saying is 100 % factual lastly you can be what you want to be but when you look at society for acceptance and can't answer basis biology question don't fault the society!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/o0rzxp/happy_pride_rnepal_a_post_for_our_lgbtq_friends/,6/15/2021 23:58,0,0,15,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

1f3zqf2,Pokhara to Ghorepani : A Hike Filled with Rhododendrons and Cherished Memories,"
It was the second week of Chaitra, 2080 (March 2024). We knew this was the season of blooming Rhododendrons, so we decided to embark on a journey to Ghorepani. Our group consisted of seven people—five boys and two girls.

**Day 1:**

We had booked a jeep for Rs 8,000, and our driver for the trip was Jomsa Dai. He came all the way from Nayapool, picking us up from Prithivichowk to Baglung Buspark. Our adventure began at 7:30 AM.

After an hour and a half, we reached Nayapool. There, we enjoyed a simple but satisfying breakfast of selroti, chiya, eggs, and chana. We also bought some snacks, spending around Rs 1,000.

As we passed Ulleri, the first Rhododendrons began to appear. After about two hours, we arrived at Banthanti, the last stop for the jeep before Ghorepani. It was noticeably colder, and the temperature had begun to drop. We had our first meal of dal bhat with masu. Since there wasn’t much meat left, a bowl cost Rs 350, and we spent around Rs 3,500 for the meal for eight people. 

After a 30-minute rest, our trek officially began. We took some group photos with Jomsa Dai, who wished us a safe journey. The trail followed the riverside, leading us across old bridges and providing countless photo opportunities. As we progressed, the rhododendrons grew larger and more vibrant, their red, pink, and white hues painting the landscape.

After a four or five-hour trek, we reached Ghorepani around 5 PM. We checked into Hotel Snowland, paying Rs 1,200 per person for a package that included breakfast, dinner, and a room. We booked two separate rooms—one for the boys and one for the girls. From our windows, we could see the rhododendrons in full bloom.

In the evening, we gathered in one room, playing music while we all had a great time. We played cards, snacked on Furandana Chatpate, and sipped on Marpha. The hotel owner, a kind lady, called out to me, ""Nani, come and have dinner."" On phone, I was touched that she remembered me, especially since the hotel was bustling with tourists. Dinner was delicious, and after a few more rounds of cards, we went to bed around 10:30, eager to wake up early for Poon Hill.

**Day 2:**

It was the day of Holi. I woke everyone up at 4 AM using my NTC sim, which was the only one working there.We started our hike up to Poon Hill around 5:30 AM. It took me an hour and a half to reach the top as I was feeling a bit nauseous, but others arrived earlier. Initially, the sky was gloomy, and the trail was crowded with visitors. However, the weather soon cleared, and we were lucky enough to witness the majestic mountains and sunrise. We took countless photos, helping others capture their memories too. The festive spirit of Holi added to the fun.

Around 9 AM, we returned to the hotel for breakfast—Tibetan roti, chiya, and eggs. I wished the hotel owner a happy Holi, and she gently applied colors to my face, saying, ""Happy Holi, Nani."" After packing our bags and memories, we cleared our bills and waved her goodbye.

Our return trip cost another Rs 8,000, bringing the total travel expenses to Rs 5,000 per person. We arrived home around 5 PM, our hearts full of unforgettable experiences.

stog6v,Khopra Danda and Mardi Himal trek in the single attempt,"hi friends,I am planning for the  Nayapul-Ulleri - Khopra dada- Chistibung- Tadapani - Chomrong - Landruk - Low camp - High camp \_ Mardi - downhill to Kande.

I have few questions:

1. How often people do both of these trek in single go? I am planning to finish this circuit in around a seven to ten days of time?
2. Is it better to go to Mardi first and then to Khopra dada or my idea is good ? Too much uphill is not fun idea :)
3. Is there still snow in the area !! How difficult will it be in the end of this week?
4. I have seen many doing solo trek to Mardi but not much in the Khopra... any reasons? Is it due to the  chances of being lost or it has to do with the popularity ?
5. Is it better to stay at Nayapool or in Pokhara? I want to start the trek as early as possible in the next day and go on the public jeep as far/high as possible. Where do you suggest?
6. I will be happy to join, if any of you are on the same route :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pokhara/comments/stog6v/khopra_danda_and_mardi_himal_trek_in_the_single/,2/16/2022 5:54,5,0,1,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,0,0,1,0,0

1cqp3m5,It feels like festivals and family events won't be that enjoyable in the future," 

Recently, I was talking with my cousins, and many of them were discussing their plans to move abroad. Some have already moved, some are in the process of applying, and others are planning to apply as soon as they finish college. This made me think about how dull various festivals and gatherings are going to be in the future. Even festivals like Dashain won't be as enjoyable anymore. I think many of us can relate to this as our close friends or cousins have moved abroad.

There was a time when we used to meet our cousins and have fun during various parties and functions, but now there are only a few of them left. You know those distant cousins that you only meet at someone's wedding or certain functions? Those events used to be the occasions where you would see them, but now even that seems unlikely. I'm not going to lie, I felt a little FOMO while listening to their plans. Not just cousins, even your close friends who you used to hang out with must be abroad now.

I'm not against the idea of moving out. At some point in life, everyone wants to pursue their dreams. We all want to improve our lives. That's how life is. However, hearing all these plans did make me feel a bit sad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1cqp3m5/it_feels_like_festivals_and_family_events_wont_be/,5/13/2024 2:54,51,0,20,English,0,0,1,0,0,2
1axpufz,How to avoid feeling lonely or isolated? How to enjoy being alone with myself?,"Hello, everyone. I had been in a relationship for a long time, but it did not work out, and it has been a few years since. I have moved on.
The challenge is, I've moved on, but the habit and need to have someone text or phone me still exists. I used to have someone who would reply to me at any moment, but now I don't. That turned out to be something of an addiction for me. I need someone to always reply to me.
So I text a bunch of people in the hopes of getting a response and easing my loneliness, whatever you call it. I feel like I'm using them for my personal benefit. And I don't want to do that. I've tried distracting myself by doing things, working, reading, and so on, but I still can't enjoy or avoid feeling lonely with just myself. 
Has anyone ever experienced a situation like this and recovered or changed? Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
Thanks.

1g74svz,"Nepal Politics: Rabi Lamichhane, Jholeys and to wannabe cool haru","**Disclaimer:** If your home, lifestyle, or bank balance is built on corrupt money earned by your father or mother, this post may trigger you. Please feel free to ignore it.

Nepal, a poor, landlocked country, has mostly been ruled by three aging leaders, each heading their own political party. These leaders are backed by loyal followers, or *jholeys*, who would do anything for small rewards like meat and rice, petrol, alcohol, or minor contracts for projects like gravel supplies, road construction, or drainage systems. These *jholeys* believe they have everything because they can call their local leader anytime. On the other hand, there are those from the *panchayat* era who wear traditional attire, like *daurwa suruwal* or proper suits, and receive respectful greetings from the villagers simply because they are the local Congress leaders. These leaders manipulate the middle and lower classes, urging them to vote for Congress or UML.

For over 30 years, these three leaders enjoyed their time in power but would publicly feud during elections, labeling one another as rivals or frauds. However, over time, people grew frustrated with them and started considering voting them out, thinking it was time to replace them with new, energetic leaders. One such rising leader even declared himself as the future prime minister, voicing strong opposition to these three aging leaders.

Then, a new political party was formed, led by a popular journalist with a large fan following. Nepal has seen similar attempts at political revolution before, such as Baburam Bhattarai's *Naya Shakti* and Ujjwal Thapa's *Bibeksheel*, but both failed to secure significant support. Though these movements garnered attention, they didn't receive enough votes. The old political parties were confident that no new party could challenge their dominance, allowing them to continue their corruption unchecked, with no one holding them accountable.

But with the arrival of this new party, which secured 21 seats through both direct and proportional elections, the old leaders were shocked—especially by the amount of support the journalist received. This stirred leaders like Gagan and others to rethink their political future. They began using the media to discredit the journalist, portraying him as the biggest liar and fraud in the country. Even though an official investigation into a cooperative scandal couldn't find any evidence against him, one individual continued to claim he had proof of the journalist’s involvement but failed to substantiate his claims. Gagan found himself in political trouble, with his career at risk as he couldn’t provide any evidence.

Meanwhile, UML and Congress faced their own challenges with the new party, RSP, which presented itself as an alternative democratic force. This was a direct threat to Congress, especially after Rabi, while serving as Home Minister, came close to arresting Arzu Rana Deuba, the wife of the then-prime minister. Bechan Jha, who was linked to Arzu, was arrested, but the government coalition collapsed that same day. Similarly, the son of UML leader Badal Thapa was arrested, and Oli’s personal assistant was on the verge of being detained. These were significant developments, but the media downplayed them to avoid boosting Rabi’s popularity.

In a country where a convicted gangster like *Managey* can become a minister repeatedly, where a convicted murderer like Resham Chaudhary leads a party and holds a position in the current government, where figures involved in the Bhutanese refugee scam, like Baal Kisne Khand, attend Congress meetings, and where a corrupt MP from Congress still sits in parliament—it's ironic that the system is doing everything possible to frame a politician who only entered the political scene two years ago as the biggest conman in Nepal.

I’m not trying to sound ""cool"" by saying, ""I’m not a fan of Rabi,"" or, ""Rabi isn’t a saint either."" If he had compromised, he could’ve had a smooth political career ahead of him. But there’s a reason why all the parties, the media, and intellectuals cry out his name from morning till night. How are people not understanding such a simple truth? It’s as if they’re trying too hard to look ""cool"" and might end up with pneumonia from all the effort. Then there’s another group—those afraid of appearing ignorant or backward—who oppose Rabi just because they believe his supporters are from the Gulf countries, and they want to seem different because they live in Europe, the US, or Australia.

Few other people are thinking this is just Rabi thing and will end with him but this won't. Tomorrow it will be swarnim and then it will be Balen. Remember how media started publishing anything that mukul dhakal used to say , like how swarnim was in contact with India to make Rabi pm of Nepal. That's how they spread propaganda to tarnish image. Tomorrow it will be Balen, cz they don't have to prove anything they just have to spread fake news.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1g74svz/nepal_politics_rabi_lamichhane_jholeys_and_to/,10/19/2024 8:57,141,0,87,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,1,1,0,1,2

1g72cwl,Rabi Lamichhane: Another Pawn in Nepal’s Never-Ending Circus?,"Recent arrest of Rabi Lamichhane is something more than a shock; it is actually a reason for all of us to wake up, especially for those of us who act like we care about the future of Nepal. A former Deputy Prime Minister, entangled in webs of fraud and organized crime, was supposed to be a beacon of hope for change. Instead, he's turned out to be just another player in the political circus, showing how deeply entrenched corruption really is.

Let's get real: we enjoy blaming politicians, but how many are actually accomplices? We whine about corruption, yet salivate in secrecy, anticipating our cut of the pie. Lamichhane promised change; now, he is deep in all those practices he had promised to bring down. Surprised? Same old story: charisma before integrity, promises over performance.

But herein lies the interesting twist: this is not about Lamichhane. His arrest brings into light a deeper rot in our political culture-a culture where we wish to have the change, but are not willing to lift a finger to make it a reality. We let ourselves be distracted by flashy leaders while the system continues to exploit us.

So, what's the bottom line? Rabi's arrest is a mirror reflecting our own failures. Are we going to continue cheering for the next big name, or are we going to strike a blow for accountability and actual reform?

Let's stir the pot: Is Lamichhane a scapegoat, or is he just another face in a long line of hypocrites? As a society, are we ready to confront our own complicity in this mess?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1g72cwl/rabi_lamichhane_another_pawn_in_nepals/,10/19/2024 5:51,94,0,68,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

t9wz8f,Organising one of the biggest house party in Kathmandu and Pokhara - you are invited.,"I am planning to come to Nepal soon with my friends. Last time I came, I went clubbing to drink, enjoy music, dance and make new friends. Unfortunately most people were already in their groups and were not interested in meeting new people. Not sure if that is just how it is in Nepal or I went to the wrong clubs (LOD and Treasure in Pokhara)

I want to book an Airbnb House to organise an epic house party full of strangers to come together for 1 night and create memories we will never forget.

**Some of the requirements are:**

\- Age - 18 to 26 - Will not be looking for ID but you cant look like someone who is in their 30's

\- I want the party to be around 1:1 male to female ratio

\- Men can bring up to 2 more male friends and as many female friends as they want.(Large group of men can be hard to handle incase something kicks off so it is better for everyone attending)

\- Unlimited drinks will be free all night for females and Rs. 500 for men. (This is to make sure the ratio stays 1:1 & you will be drinking alcohol worth a lot more than Rs. 500)

**For your health and safety:**

\- Someone will be hired to work as a Bartender and they will not serve you more drinks if they think you are too drunk. Once you freshen up a little bit they will serve you again.

\- If anyone becomes or shows sign of aggression towards others. You will be KICKED out.

If you guys are interested to be a part of this crazy house party then let me know on the comment and if you have any suggestions on how to find more people who want to come or have any questions, let me know. I would also appreciate if you guys can upvote this post so more people can see this and we have a chance to create a special moment.

Update no.1 - The party will be on the Weekend. The exact location and time will be sent directly to your inbox once everything is organised along side asking how many people you are brining. If you guys have a venue you want to recommend, leave a link.

Update no.2 - People of reddit, since I only saw men reply who don't have even one female friend to invite, I was going to cancel it and organise it somewhere else but then I realised it is precisely you men that need to enjoy a females company.

15yya13,What's your biggest regret in life?,"Just a month ago, I turned 20 years old( end of teenage years, and start of young adulthood). I haven't had many regrets in life until now except few like quitting a trainee position in very reputable audit firm (I still regret this decision everyday)and not having much memories with friends in +2 (as I was working parttime and focusing on my US college application, also COVID took away one year of highschool). Even though I dedicated almost 3 years to this, still I got my visa rejected. However, I don't regret it now as I used to since I see my future in India or Canada, not in US. Apart from this, I am really irresponsible child but doing good in terms of my career. To sum it up, my biggest regret in life is not enjoying my teenage life but looking back, it doesn't hurt much as I was involved in productive activities.

sd0wvk,My two cents on Miss Nepal's opinion about corruption,"Some politicians kid who happens to be a Miss Nepal and happens to be a Masters student in Urban Planning at Harvard was providing their insights on how Nepali people should vote and root out corruption.

Their opinion is valid as a Nepali citizen. But I remember one important lesson from school.

""Sansar badalna aafu ra aafno ghar bata suruwat garnu parcha.""

So, is this individual willing to start it from their own households and their own father or what? 

Corruption ko jati kura gare pani, is this person going to provide clear audit of their own father's finances considering that person's father is a politician.

Or is this another celebrity giving us some more lolipop?

Walk the talk is what I expect from this individual's intellect. Let's hope for it.

Disclaimer:

I have no dog in the fight. I like this person's outlook more than other people. This person's is also highly capable in their own right.

Edit:
I read through a lot of the comments. Those who misunderstand the prompt, here is my take after I have thoroughly read the comments.

Elon Musk was born rich, his family owned emerald mines in a Segregated South Africa.
He is currently one of the richest human beings on the planet.
He has innovated space industry and made a huge dent against Climate Change.
Does that mean we cannot discuss his family's roots? How he had a leg up and how he could display his talents on a world stage? So, that's beyond question as well?  So, because a person is talented, charismatic, is very nationalistic and wants to do great for the country/humanity, means they are beyond analysis? We are to take the person just for their actions, great.

This logic dictates that might is right. Because we are not looking at it from a social dynamic but just the utilitarian perspective. If the utility of this individual is high, this individual should be beyond reproach. If that is the case, we should abolish transfer of assets from one generation to the other. Because, you are not liable to the evil your ancestors/parents do, you should not ask for the privilege they provide.

This is asking to cherry pick the best parts and ignore the bad parts. That does sit well with your logic, if you believe this person is not liable to their parents mistakes. This has nothing to do with you as a person or even Elon Musk, or even the Miss Nepal in discussion. I hope you see the flaw in your logic. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

My viewpoint is not to discredit the potential and ability of the person but the character of the individual. Character of the individual is formed by the hard decisions and choices that person makes. If they enjoy the successes from the privilege of their parents, they should own up the mistakes of their parents. That is what builds character.

I hope you or anyone don't take this personally. I just wanted to highlight how actual accountability works in my head, not anyone elses but mine. Since, this country is a democracy, I really believe its just my opinion, and you should form your own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/sd0wvk/my_two_cents_on_miss_nepals_opinion_about/,1/26/2022 8:07,247,0,149,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,1,1,0,0,2
1e5h6sk,Planning to treat myself with a car,"As a guy, who never got interested in expensive stuffs or luxurious lifestyle even after I started earning good, I think it’s time to treat myself with something that I will actually enjoy, a car. I was always interested in tech gadgets and cars but never crossed my mind to buy one because It’s not that essential for me or my family. Now as I am thinking to buy one, which will be the good option? EV vs ICE and new vs second hand. My budget is around 30L-40L but possible to increase it, if doing so would provide more value. My inclination is towards new EV just because it will be my first car and I want a cool looking car but open to other ideas and reasonings. I will appreciate any suggestions, recommendations and experience.

15uqzpx,How much income is required to be financially free in Nepal?,"hello, I am 21 year old guy from KTM. As my 20s began, my responsibilities increased. Taking care of my parents, my future family, and the people that I care about has been my goal ever since I started earning. 

I currently make around 7 Lakhs a month in profit with my online business ( All legal + Registered + paying taxes ). I know this is a decent income but the feeling of "" Can I help my family sustain with this? "" does hit.

Because of this, I refrain from spending much money on anything ( Apart from Insurance, college fees, and home expenses + Loans ). I do want to travel or go on a holiday and maybe buy a car but I want to settle my parents first and set up an investment portfolio for them if I leave for abroad after my bachelor's. Because of this I usually invest around 80% of my monthly income. My parents struggled a lot back in the days to give me this life so I want to give them back before anything else.

So my question is, how much income is necessary to live a good life in Nepal and be financially free? ( Parents and family taken care of + Holidays and decent life )? I feel like I'm really focused on money and responsibility rather than enjoying my life to a degree. 

Advice from older people would be extremely valuable. Thank you

Excerpts

Gaushala-26, as she is identified by the code name assigned by the law enforcement agency, says she has been hiding for the past five months and counting. “I haven’t been able to enjoy sunlight because I have to stay hidden. But I have been following what’s happening outside. I can see people sympathising with the perpetrator, presenting him as the victim,” she says. According to her citizenship certificate details that Kantipur, the Post’s sister paper, is privy to, she is still a minor.

Her citizenship was issued on June 29, 2022. The birthdate on the certificate says June 1, 2005. According to this, she was only 17 when the incident happened.

On Sunday, August 21, when Lamichhane came in a white car to pick her up, she says she was “impressed”. “All I could say was ‘Wow’,” she recalls. Lamichhane requested her to sit in the car, but hadn’t mentioned their destination. They talked about the tournament he was leaving for the next day. “Once we reached Koteshwar, I asked where we were going. He said—let’s see!” Gaushala-26 says. “That was the first time I was leaving my hostel at that hour in the day. I didn’t know it would be my last.”

The car started, and the journey had begun. From Lokanthali, the car took the inner road. “Once we reached there, he decided to go to Nagarkot. I had never been there. We had left the main road and were on a narrow lane, where it was difficult to manoeuvre the vehicle,” she says. “When I think back on that day, he may have taken that route to cause delays.”

Once they reached Nagarkot, Lamichhane tried to coerce Gaushala-26 to drink, but she refused. He urged her to try ‘Hookah’ he had brought for himself, but she refused. But the conversation was amicable. “So far, he was fine. Since I had shared my stories with him, he was trying to motivate me,” she says. “But now when I recall those conversations, I think he was manipulating me into trusting him. Since he knew about my background and my financial condition, he tried to level with me saying that he too comes from a background similar to mine and to look where he was today. He said if he could do it, so could I.""

She thought that what she had heard about Lamichhane being arrogant and egotistic was baseless. “I thought people misunderstood him. A high-profile person was talking to me so nicely. Back then, I was thinking I will tell my friends how wrong they were in presuming Lamichhane was full of himself.” Gaushala-26 recalls how the hotel staff asked Lamichhane several times if they should book a VIP room for him. She said she needs to return to her hostel before it’s too late but Lamichhane never said he didn’t need the room the hotel staff were offering. “Several times he asked them to come back after 5 or 10 minutes. I wasn’t planning to go to Nagarkot. I didn’t even know that a cricketer who was going abroad the next day would have so much time. I had thought I’d meet him and take a picture, but it was close to 11pm. I started to insist that I had to return,” she says. That’s when Lamichhane got angry, she says. “He told me I can’t ‘digest’ it—the good things happening to me. He started humiliating me by saying that he has taken a person like me to a hotel I could never afford. I will never forget it. He said nice things are not palatable to the likes of me.”


After the argument, they left Nagarkot. When they reached Lokanthali, she sent a text to her friend. “I was afraid of the questions I would be asked for returning so late. I told Lamichhane that it would be difficult for me to return to the hostel at such a late hour,” she says. “He said he would leave me at a hotel and he would return to the hotel where other players were staying at.” To avoid being asked uncomfortable questions and to avoid reprimand from the hostel operator, she agreed to go to the hotel. “I thought I would sleep at the hotel and go to the hostel the next morning,” she says. “Then I tried to take his picture while we were talking since that was the main objective of meeting him. But he snatched my mobile phone and didn’t let me take pictures. Even then I didn’t think anything was amiss. I thought he would get in trouble at the camp for staying out late too.” 


Lamichanne then placed a call to one Anish Shrestha of Kathmandu Inn Hotel at Tilganga. “He asked him to prepare “that” room. I told him to ask them to prepare two separate rooms if I were to stay there the night but he told me there was only one room available at the moment.” “Then he said he would drop me at the hotel and he would leave,” she says. At the hotel gate, before dropping her off, Lamichhane asked her to put a mask on. “I didn’t have one so he gave me the one he was using insisting I wear it,” she says.


Lamichhane went to park the car after sending Gaushala-26 towards the reception where Shrestha was waiting with a key to the room. She went to the room to find that it was a single room. “After a while, he came to the room. The air conditioner in the room wasn’t working so he said we should move to another room. That’s when I realised he lied to me earlier when he said there was only one room available,” she says. “I told him I will stay in this room even if the air conditioner is not working and that he should go to the other room. He said he would go after a while.” Gaushala-26 had had a long day. Spending all morning at the office, then attending college, and then the unexpected trip to Nagarkot and back had exhausted her. She hadn’t even had her dinner which left her more exhausted. 


“He said he would leave the room in a while. I was sitting on a chair and he was on the bed. He said if I was tired, I should sit on the bed,” she says. “When I asked for my phone back, he said he had left it in the car. By then I was too tired to ask him to bring it. I soon began dozing off.” The next thing she was aware of was Lamichhane pressing against her, feeling her. “He was forcing himself on me. I tried to throw his hands away but I could not. He then began to penetrate me. Once he was done, he went to the bathroom. I could feel his semen all over my body. When he came out of the bathroom, he brought a bunch of tissue papers and threw it at me asking me to clean myself up,” she recalls. According to Gaushala-26, she was told not to tell anyone about their meeting. “After the incident, he threatened me and asked me not to tell anyone about it,” she says. “I couldn’t leave. I didn’t even know where I was.” Then on September 6, 2022, she went to the police. 


“Several people are questioning me why I didn’t go to the police immediately. In movies, rape victims are shown with blood on them; their clothes are torn and hurt badly or killed. So until those things happen, people assume it’s not rape. I want to ask those people if I were killed, would they believe me?” “What happened that day was not by my consent. I didn’t consent to being raped either with my actions or my words. Going to Nagarkot was not my plan, neither was staying at the hotel. It was Lamichhane all along. He committed a premeditated crime.”


In Nepal, seven women and children are raped every day. Nepal Police’s statistics for the fiscal year 2021-2022 show the number of incidents of rape, kidnapping and rape, rape and killing stood at 2,461. However, since most incidents of rape survivors are not made public, people assume that such incidents don’t happen. In the case of rape survivors, the victim is asked to prove that the crime against her actually happened. “I was in such a state that if you ask me to recall the colour of the room, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I don’t remember how this atrocity began and how it ended,” she says. “But he knew exactly what he was doing. Later that night, he raped me again. My hair was waist-long. He pulled my hair and made me do things I wasn’t comfortable with. Unable to do anything to stop what was happening to me, I began to cry. After that, he hit me badly asking me to submit to him. A few days later, when the shock had started wearing off, the first thing I did was cut my hair.”


In the morning after the dreadful night, she took a picture of Lamichanne’s license plate and sent it to Dev Khanal. “After that Lamichhane called and yelled at me for taking and sending the picture,” she says. A few minutes later, he removed her from his Snapchat friends’ list. Gaushala-26 did not go to work or college for the next few days. When she built up enough courage, she told her close friend about the incident. “He did not believe me. He said it must have been my fault. My friend did not trust me,” she says. A few days later she went to meet her mother. “After a couple of days of staying with her, I asked her why she wasn’t curious about my visit. She said it’s good that I was home because she missed me,” she says. “I then told her about what happened. She slapped me hard.” “My mother herself was a victim of violence. She was worried about me, about how I would not have any prospects of marriage,” she says. “At first, my mother said I should forget about it because he was a powerful man, but I convinced her that I must speak up because if an educated person like me doesn’t, who will?” 


Gaushala-26 says that there have been efforts to change her statement. “Lamichhane’s brother went to my mother pretending to be my lawyer. He told her we can’t win the case and offered settlement money,” she says. “They told me they will help me settle wherever I want—the US or Singapore. They offered $500,000. I didn’t accept.”

“The victim in Paul Shah’s case was made to change her statement. If I change my statement, other rape victims and survivors like me will never see justice. We will continue being raped,” says Gaushala-26.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/11b9xas/for_you_he_might_be_the_accused_but_for_me_he_is/,2/25/2023 2:46,179,0,100,English and Nepali,1,1,1,0,1,2
1grlzj2,Is this normal or am I adopted,"
Hey wassup ! 
I’m just curious if anyone else has gone through  this or if it’s common in our society. Every time I bring up the idea of coming back to Nepal for a vacation for short period of time, my family seems disappointed and almost discourages the idea about my vacation. They often say things like, “You’re a man, focus on working hard and earning for yourself. This isn’t the age for enjoyment or relaxation.”

It’s as if any time I want a break, I’m met with reminders to keep pushing through and only relax “when the time is right.” They see it as unnecessary or even irresponsible to come home for a break right now, and instead, they want me to stay focused on work and earning.

I understand the value of hard work, but it feels draining sometimes when there’s no support for taking a short vacation or even thinking about unwinding for a bit. 

Does anyone else go through this with their family? Or is this a common mindset in Nepali culture or it’s just in mine?

18and9d,"People of r/Nepal, how excited are you for the upcoming gta 6 trailer?","Im pretty sure most if not all of you have heard about GTA games at least once. Despite what the age restriction says, anyone can get into GTA, there is no learning curve, and you dont have to master the game in order to enjoy it, there is something for everyone. gta is like what Messi and Ronaldo are to football, Micheal Jackson is to  pop music, Eminem is to hiphop, Nelson Mandela is to Africa, Rajesh Hamal is to Nepali pop culture, Sylvester Stallone is to Rocky, Rock is to action movies, Captain America is to Avengers, Batista is to wild animals, John Cena is to WWE, Gta games are synonymous to videogames and the big daddy is making a comeback after 10 long years.

I personally am not too excited about it. The gameplay leaks look more like tech demos than an actual game. I know those were pre alpha footages but the gameplay still looked bland and lifeless. The rumor is there is so much realism in the game, im afraid it ill end up being boring and a huge portion of the game will feel like a chore . im also worried it will have an empty map like gta v with vast open spaces in between with nothing to do and there wont be much left after you complete the game. i really hope they bring back the physics from gta iv. Physics in gta v was dumbed down from gta iv. The vehicle destruction physics is non existent in gta v compared to gta iv. Everything looks bland compared to older games, the saturation is dialed down which i think they did that on purpose because the colors in xbox360 ps3 version were much more lively than on current version. it doesnt even have an art style anymore, it doesnt stand out at all. The only redeeming part of the game is its story and the characters and about 80% of the missions. the cutscenes were also top notch and still stand out till date and have aged incredibly for a 10 year old game. and the jokes and the overall humor, i dont think there is any other game that is on the same scale that is more stupider while having such well crafted characters and cutscenes. But take all that out, its a lifeless game, even in between missions it gets pretty boring once you have roamed around enough times. Im specifically talking about single player, i havent played more than two hours of multiplayer.

But more than anything im worried i wont feel a thing or rather wont be as excited as last time i was excited for a similar thing of this scale even if the trailer checks all the boxes i mentioned, and all that hype will have been for nothing. if gta 6 trailer cant get me hyped up or even excited, i dont know what will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18and9d/people_of_rnepal_how_excited_are_you_for_the/,12/4/2023 16:05,37,0,91,English,1,0,1,0,0,0

107a5d2,Why eat meat? how do you justify eating meat?,"My opinion is that if you have enough access to veg food then it makes no sense to kill these animals, just for the pleasure of the  tongue. We have been gifted a body capable of handling both meat and plants but we have also been gifted a mind that can rationalize and choose. 

- one might say ""plants are alive too"" : yeah, they are but in the majority of the cases, you mostly don't have to Kill the entire plant to consume the food from it, whereas the animal is gonna lose its life 

- plants do not have pain receptors and cannot feel pain, whereas you'll see animals suffering. Everyone would still be eating veggies if they had to procure their own food but most meat eaters would 'chicken out' if asked to hunt for their food. 

- veg diet is **almost** always healthier and you reduce your risk of heart problems, cholesterol, cancer by tenfold when you don't consume meat. Meat is an 'easier' source of protein and one or two vitamins  not a better one. We see veg and vegan athletes at the top level of every sport

- "" but but.. Meat is delicious"" really?  Try it raw and without adding all the spices in the world and and see if you still like it. I still like fruits without all the nonsense

- the meat industry is f*cked up. Their treatment of animals is piss poor, they're fed thousands of drugs and antibiotics and there's no hygiene 

- we struggle to digest meat in comparison to veggies. Digesting meat takes 2-3 times longer. ""it's due to the high fat and protein content"" is a common counter but carnivores digest meat in an instant so it further proves we aren't adapted well enough to meat. Our Intestines resemble that of herbivores more than that of carnivores as well

- we have no natural hunting tools. Our canines(gorillas have larger canines but have a veg based diet) and claws are a joke for hunting. Hunting only started after fire and tools were discovered / made. (imagine a human squaring up against a carnivore, lmao) 

So I see no reason to eat meat except if there is a question of survival or scarcity. 

Cooked and spiced meat is tasty and enjoyment for our tongues for 10 minutes. Is it really justified torturing animals for those 10 minutes? Let me know your thoughts

P. S I'm not here to ask people to quit meat, just asking what makes them do so

Edit : Hello pea brains. At least have the decency to do a simple Google search before talking crap here. LMAO all these unnecessary personal attacks cuz deep down you mfs lying to yourselves.  You all are coping real hard. There can be some nice arguments from the meat eating side too, but haven't seen them so far in this ignorant comment section.

Infinity war is one of my favourites and Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Civil War, Dr Strange, Avengers (all of them), Ant Man, Thor ragnarok are still top notch for me. Or this is what I would like to believe, meaning I really enjoyed watching them. But recently l, I have started to find marvel movie just bearable. 

There are series being launched by marvel and most of them are mediocre (all of them have a good story to tell but is that enough?), saving Moon Knight, Wanda Vision and Loki.

Its not that I find them utterly boring or unbearable, it's just I don't find the same excitement and energy surging while watching the movie.

My question is is it because I aged a bit or have they really started compromising their contents with lame one liners and over justified villain?

y0cc1w,Pain for brother who don't have sister,"Hello Nepali reditor of redit. You guys know that their is festival called tihar knocking the door, many people love this festival who have their own brother and sister. The pain is for those who don't have any sister. I am 18 year old and soon I will be 19. I did not celebrated this festival with my sister cause I don't have any sister. I always go to my father sister or my maternal uncle daughter to put tika. But, they don't treat me like their brother they were just forced to put tika tika to me. Tho, I have my own uncle daughter she never invited me saying brother please come and put tika after all I am your sister we are blood related. I don't think so this problem is only with me. Back 2 years I didn't put tika with anyone and during Bhai tika some of my friend call me to hangout but seeing them put tika and enjoying tihar my tear burst out of pain. From that day I have never gone out in tika cause everyone has sister and they are enjoying that day. For me tihar is curse cause there is no-one to put tika and accept me as there brother. I always stay at my room and cry during this festival. I don't think my own blood related sister also don't think me as her brother but she is sister for me. It's not like I have never talk about this topic to her. I did talk about this topic to her in indirect way but the way she replied my text broke my heart. I am thinking to stay in my room seeing other brother and sister celebrating that day scrolling Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and crying. tho my uncle daughter will not call me in tika but I am thinking to send her gift such as hoodies or sweatshirt for her as a gift without writing my name on package.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/y0cc1w/pain_for_brother_who_dont_have_sister/,10/10/2022 11:28,45,0,106,English,0,0,1,0,1,2
1ehz3fm,Never use a Nepali Flag in kanwar Baba Dham India.,"I recently visited Baba Dham and had an incident involving the Nepali flag that I want to share. When I arrived, there were over 1.2 million people there, including many Nepalis. I noticed some of them speaking Nepali, enjoying time with friends, and smoking marijuana. Many had placed the Nepali flag on their kanwars—a single bamboo pole used to carry two loads of Ganga Jal on their shoulders as they walked to the Lord Shiva Mandir.

The route is around 110 km, but spiritually it’s considered 108 km. Along the way, I found a Nepali flag lying on the road. I felt sad and upset seeing people walk over it. I quickly picked it up, holding it in my right hand while I carried my kanwar with the other. It hurt to see such carelessness with the flag.

I carried the flag until I reached the Dham and then placed it respectfully in the pandal house where Nepali priests perform pooja. 

I understand it’s difficult to carry a broken flag for more than 60 km, but it’s not acceptable to simply discard it. If your flag gets damaged, you should return rather than abandon it. I urge everyone to use a different flag, like a Mahakaal flag, at Baba Dham. Please don’t use a national flag in such contexts.

This is my humble request.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ehz3fm/never_use_a_nepali_flag_in_kanwar_baba_dham_india/,8/2/2024 2:39,80,0,25,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

y2vhu6,AITA for complaining and asking some money as I was short?,"BACKSTORY: I (18F) am a single daughter of a middle class family. I am not usually allowed to have trips or vacations outside my family but recently was offered by my friend (18F) to go to her hometown( dhangadhi) . She told me that I had to only worry about my plane tickets and personal expenses ( shopping). Everything else would be covered by her family. Also I had never been to that place and was really excited so I tried to convince my family. They were ready to send me but I had no support financially from them. My boyfriend (22M) sent me rs15000 for help but that was just enough for plane tickets. I managed rs8000 from here and there so I had enough money. 

Everything went as per plan until I reached there. We were going to visit lucknow as we were near the border so I had to change the currency (Npr to Inr) . I gave all  my money to my friend's uncle( who was sponsering the trip) so I had nothing left with me. I was enjoying the trip until her uncle repeatedly mocked me. he was super rude and so full of himself that the whole trip felt awkward. He didn't give my money for shopping till the very end and when he gave me money.. he only gave 4000 for 7000 . I thought that he would give back my money but he didn't. Instead he would repeatedly ask me to pay for simple things like the bus etc. We were there so that we could do shopping for cheap but he took us to malls where single piece of cloth was worth my whole trip. I was very frustrated so I finally spoke to him about cheap market. He took us there but only gave us around an hour to shop. That was a place where we had to bargain for half an hour for a single item, what could I buy! still we did our shopping and when we returned he shouted at me saying that he now has to bear the loss because me. According to him I was late so we missed the train but in reality I just went along with their family and didnot take any time anywhere. We took the next train and the ticket was even cheaper. He was rude to me for the whole trip yet I was silent. He was soo rude that a person was literally dying in front of me being cut into head and body under the train and he yelled at me for shouting ""stop the train"". 

Now my friend is angry at me for complaining about her uncle. I am in short of money now so I asked her to give me a small amount as compensation but she is angry because what money I lost was because of her uncle and that isn't her problem. 

In my opinion, if I was informed that my extra money was being used I would have made my budget likewise. I was accused several times that her uncle had to bear loss while the expenses were not that much. Her uncle even took her money but that was returned as a return gift while I had no money to even return my home.

Here's a suggested itinerary for a memorable day exploring the highlights of Kathmandu:

# Morning:

**1. Swayambhunath Stupa (Monkey Temple)**: Begin your day with a visit to Swayambhunath, a UNESCO World Heritage Site perched atop a hill west of Kathmandu Valley. Explore the ancient stupa adorned with colorful prayer flags and watch mischievous monkeys play amidst the sacred surroundings. Enjoy panoramic views of Kathmandu city and the distant Himalayas.

**2. Kathmandu Durbar Square**: Next, head to Kathmandu Durbar Square, a historic plaza brimming with palaces, temples, and courtyards. Marvel at the intricate woodcarvings of the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, visit the house of the living goddess Kumari, and admire the architectural marvels of Taleju Temple and the Kal Bhairav statue.

# Midday:

**3. Lunch at a Local Eatery**: Take a break from sightseeing and indulge in a delicious Nepali meal at one of Kathmandu's authentic eateries. Sample traditional dishes like momos (dumplings), dal bhat (rice and lentils), or Newari cuisine for a flavorful culinary experience.

# Afternoon:

**4. Patan Durbar Square**: After lunch, venture to Patan Durbar Square, located in the city of Lalitpur, known for its fine Newari architecture and exquisite craftsmanship. Explore the intricately carved temples, ancient palaces, and the famous Golden Temple (Hiranya Varna Mahavihara), a Buddhist monastery adorned with gold.

**5. Boudhanath Stupa**: Conclude your day with a visit to Boudhanath Stupa, one of the largest stupas in Nepal and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Circumambulate the massive white dome adorned with prayer wheels and colorful flags, soak in the spiritual atmosphere, and observe pilgrims and monks in contemplative prayer.

# Evening:

**6. Thamel Exploration**: As the day winds down, take some time to explore Thamel, Kathmandu's bustling tourist district. Stroll along narrow alleys lined with shops selling handicrafts, clothing, and souvenirs. Browse through vibrant markets, sip on exotic teas at cozy cafes, or unwind with live music at a local bar.

**7. Dinner and Cultural Show**: Wrap up your Kathmandu day tour with a traditional Nepali dinner accompanied by a cultural show featuring live music and dance performances. Immerse yourself in the rich tapestry of Nepali culture and bid farewell to Kathmandu with unforgettable memories.

I´m staying in Thamel With only 3 full  days I´m determined to visit places that culturally, religiously and arquitecturally define Kathmandu and its surroundings. (probably getting around by cabs)

(Swayambhunath, Pashupatinnath, Taleju bhawani, Hanuman Dhoka, Buddah Stuppa and Kathmandu durbar in Kathmandu. Bhaktapur and Patan (Nyatapola Temple and Bhairavanath temple.)

Please let me know if I´ve missed anything :) 

&#x200B;

Day 1:

1)Morning: Visit Taleju Bhawani and Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu Durbar Square.


  
2) Midmorning to noon: Spend a couple of hours exploring the monkey temple (Swayambhunath) temple complex and enjoying the panoramic view of Kathmandu. Get a bite to eat. 

3)afternoon: Head to Pashupatinath Temple around 4. Visit the main temple and observe the cremation ceremony on the the Bagmati River at dusk. Does this happen everynight?

&#x200B;

Day 2:

1) morning: begin the day at the Boudhanath Stupa. Spend sometime checking out the nearby monesteries. Have breakfast in one of the tibetan restaurants overlooking the stoopa. 

2) Get a cab to Patan durbar. Will this take all day? Any idea what I can do afterwards?

&#x200B;

Day 3: Pretty much spend all the day at Bhaktapur durbar and afterwards get lost in Bhaktapur streets and try Newari food. I understand Bhaktapur is more intricate than Patan. Will it take the entire day or should I look for additional plans? I was thinking of visiting Changu Narayan village and its temple. Thoughts?

 Cheers!

1giiwnz,Which trek would you choose? (Guide recs also needed),"Hi Reddit community, my friend and I are super excited to do one of the treks in the Annapurna region starting in mid-November! We’re having a hard time deciding which trek to do based on some background and limitations:

* This will be my first trek. I’m average fitness, eg a few days of 8-10miles of hilly city walking doesn’t phase me. I do have one wonky knee so I do have to wear a knee brace when I anticipate hiking or walking a lot.
* My friend is similar, and has done a 4-day trek elsewhere before. In addition to her similar wonky knee, she has recently sprained her ankle a month ago that’s still tender. 
* My friend does not have waterproof hiking shoes, and it seems too late to purchase and break in a brand new pair of shoes. 
* We’re considering hiring a local guide or guide-porter as we love to learn more about culture and history, and are also concerned about safety. We do have a budget to consider so we prefer not to book through an agency, and would rather help the locals directly. **Does anyone have any recs for English speaking local guides you’ve really enjoyed? Guides that are women are +1.**

We’re currently considering between Poon Hill, Mardi Himal, and Annapurna Base Camp. We’ve done quite a bit of research and they all sound super awesome with amazing views, and ideally we would go for the Annapurna Circuit if we didn’t have our knee and ankle concerns. Some pros and cons we’ve come up with so far:

* Poon Hill: a shorter trek that we feel more confident in finishing with the least risk of pain. Since it’s well established, we may also consider this without a guide. 
* Mardi Himal: We’ve heard it’s less commonly trekked so we’re hopeful it will be a more local experience, but in contrast it would mean the accommodations will likely be less comfortable. Another pro is that it’s a bit longer than Poon Hill but not having to commit to the distance of the ABC. 
* ABC: We have the time for a longer trek so we would love to take advantage of this luxury, but we’re just unsure if our knees can handle it.

1dx3jui,What gives you hope about Nepal?,"Let me start by saying Nepal has a long way to go. That's why we see so many leave the country everyday. Heck, I left because I couldn't take it. But I'm wondering, what are a few things that give you hope about the country? Obviously, it will take time, but I wonder what things you're noticing that make you think we might just slowly get there. I was born in the early 90s, and anyone born around the same time obviously understands all the chaos around the civil war and then the countless gang fights. I left because I saw no hope, but now I plan on coming back in the next few months. I was also in Nepal last year and stayed for over eight months. Decided I wanted to come back and give it a shot.

Now, here are a few things I saw that give me hope (FYI, these are just small random things I noticed):

1. The younger generation seems to be more aware of their rights and the importance of voting. Growing up, all I would hear is ""Politics is a dirty game,"" lol. I don't think a lot of my friends knew their rights. But seeing younger people speaking up and demanding services for their taxes is very refreshing.
2. Last time I was there, I saw quite a few people returning in the hopes that they can contribute to the economy. Yes, a lot more are leaving than coming back, but in the hopes of keeping this thread a bit positive, I just wanted to highlight that.
3. Things are getting more and more digitalized. Growing up, I hated having to go pay for electricity or internet because I knew that meant waiting hours and hours in line.
4. People seem to be following the traffic rules more. Again, it's nowhere near where it needs to be. There are still so many aholes out on the street, but seeing more and more people taking accountability was refreshing.
5. Customer service has gotten much better.

Now I'm keeping it very general. Obviously, it's amazing that there are no longer 18-hour load-shedding periods. Roads seem more maintained, and the streets are relatively cleaner than in the past. Now, what are you noticing that gives you hope? Let's hear it, no matter how small.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1dx3jui/what_gives_you_hope_about_nepal/,7/7/2024 0:13,28,0,31,English,0,0,1,1,0,1

Balen has been in charge for only 3 months or so, but has done more than enough to earn his respect. After a Congress Politician decided to interrupt Balen in removing a corn shop in a footpath, there has been purely no interference from the jholey parties in Balen's work (unless Balen is harming their own buildings or so). I think this is because of the upcoming election, because if anyone from a party speaks against Balen who has so much public support now, will have their votes cut and cost them the election.

12lenoi,New year of Pessimism or hope for Nepal,"Last week I attended few seminar type of people who travelled all 77 districts of Nepal on foot, cycle or bike. I jotted down few interesting points and thought of sharing here.

**The Good:**

1. Almost all Nepalese have roof over their head. Homelessness is very low, except for alcoholic (mostly wife kicked husband out) or serious mental health issues and disability. Almost 0 women are homeless. Not saying there aren't any, obviously there are and things need to improve for them.
2. I know fellow redditors get hyper hearing this, but caste system/ kul / ethnicity / tribalism works wonder for our society. It is the only social security we have. Unless we come up with a social design to provide robust social security; no amount of liberal thinking, education and social media outcry is going to change the ground reality. Concept like arranged marriage, caste, kul puja etc. exists to this day, because it is the only social institution that works in Nepal.
3. Nepalese are way more politically aware than the rest of the world, maybe a bit exaggeration but you get the gist.
4. Surprisingly, we are way more resilient than you think. Maybe it has to do with the terrain? But damn, we are ""jyadro"".
5. Nepal is poor, but Nepalese are rich. This is not a myth. Sure, we have relative poverty and hunger, but only by western standards. People are eating (well most of them are). World Bank and INGOs should seriously change their way of measuring poverty and hunger.

**The Bad:**

1. Social fabric are slowly collapsing. Trust on media is all time low.
2. Loneliness is on the rise.
3. Religious protectionism is rising, partly because of Christianity especially in the Mongolian race (sorry for the lack of better word). This will only get worse.

**The Ugly:**

1. Almost no youth shows the desire to stay in Nepal. There are no young people in most villages. Ghost village is going to be a norm.
2. Nationalism is waning. Patriotism is all time low.
3. Nepalese actually do have a low IQ (assuming it is a good standard of measurement). Even if you do not believe in the concept of IQ, we actually do have very low common sense. Except for our social function - which we derive from religion, culturally we have very pathetic common sense and very inefficient way of doing things like farming, construction, building, aesthetic or design etc.

This is life and it is a sign you are alive, it sucks sometimes, but you just don’t give up yet. It is completely fine to not have the energy to do anything some days. These low days make us appreciate the good days in life.

Life is not what we had or what we did in past nor it is what we become, we all be dead at the end after all. Life is what we are today, what we have at the present moment. No one has figured out life yet, everyone is trying to figure it out every day.

breath and try to appreciate what you have today, you have another day to live, another day to experience life. I hope you have a good day today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/12upldo/hope_you_have_a_good_day/,4/22/2023 1:12,139,0,21,English,1,0,1,1,0,1

17hj8ka,Navigating My Academic Journey: From High Hopes to Uncertainty,"[19M] I was always a pretty good student, never settling for second place. My SEE exams got canceled due to COVID. I was so sure I'd score a 4 GPA. I kept studying for three whole months, hoping they'd reschedule it, but no luck. When I got that 4 GPA from my school, I wasn't happy since I couldn't attend the exam. It felt like free marks.

After some time, I started college and got a mobile phone for online classes. Big mistake – I got hooked on my phone and barely passed my Class 11 first terminal exams with a weak 63%. But, I turned things around, worked hard, and managed a 3.96 GPA in Class 11. Then came Class 12, and I was all about preparing for the CEE exam. I'd even watch lectures before my teachers could finish them. I'd solve all the MCQs and was getting over 120 marks in tests.


But here's the deal – I'm a bit confused about what I really want to do. When people asked me what I wanted to be, I'd mumble ""CA"" because of my uncles, but I got pulled into medicine because my friends were all into the CEE exam stuff. I passed +2 with a 3.85GPA.

Now, for the big change – after +2, I left home for the first time. I joined an institute, but I ended up hating it, so I went back to self-preparation. I was doing well, but then, I took a break for a family event and fell into procrastination. For six months, I didn't touch my books. I was in a hostel, and my mobile became my new best friend.

After the CEE exam, I got a rank between 700-800 for MBBS. I decided to take a year off. I dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon, but after two months, I got a new aspiration – Computer Science. I decided to leave CEE preparation and joined an IT-related course in Nepal. I had also given the Bsc.CSIT exam as a backup and got a decent rank of under 300. I ended up not filling the priority form again, a very big mistake. I was thinking I would not study in Nepal, so why should I fill the form? Another big mistake. I had also filled out the IOE form as a backup, but I hadn't studied anything till now, knowing I'd likely get a rank below 1500 and could get a college for a backup. I'm very concerned because there are only 7 days left for my exam.

 I'm 19, also preparing for the SAT, and I have my exam in December. I'm still not sure if I'll really go to the USA for my study. I'm confused. I've made some big mistakes, and I'm feeling lost. I know I can do great things, but I lack consistency because I don't have a clear dream. I'm not sure where my life is going. I don't have any special skills – my daily routine is just sleeping, eating, and watching movies. 😭  I'm feeling hopeless, and I don't know what to do. I procrastinate a lot. I always tell myself that I'll start today, but I can't. 😭
I'm hoping to hear some advice, share similar experiences, or get guidance on finding direction and overcoming procrastination. Thanks for listening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/17hj8ka/navigating_my_academic_journey_from_high_hopes_to/,10/27/2023 8:56,13,0,21,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

I know it is a longshot but hey we waited decades right?  I know it might be a little far-sighted but I cant help myself.

Here is my experience after the first ride

- Pathao rider explained that there are enough available riders even at night, 24/7
- When you first meet the rider, s/he will only know your original price. Only after you reach your destination will they know your actual price after promo and discount and whatnot. So dont be confused if the price shown to them initially is different from what was shown to you, dont panic, their app will show the correct price after you reach the destination",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/14hhvhn/first_time_pathao_i_have_a_few_questions_about/,6/24/2023 3:13,5,0,16,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,1,0,0,1,0,0

102b22q,"Despair, Hope and no hope. Just a distraction. A tale of populistic leaders","**So kindly read this;** 

Once there was a populist leader in a country and there was a huge problem of landslide in the roadside of that country. So that leader would go volunteer to pick the rocks from the landslide everyday and take some media with him and since he was making life easier for people, he was becoming a popular person in the country. And again next year, there would be landslide in that road and he would again volunteer to pick the rocks. He would also help the people who were in the accident. He would click photos with a girl who had been injured in the accident. He would go viral.

But every year the problem would be same. So that leader would repeat the same things. He was considered a hero.

But after his death a visionary leader saw that the road was in a wrong spot so he invested millions and made a new round from round a valley so that landslide couldn't affect it. Though he didn't get fame, his work was truly revolutionary.

And i am worried that Nepal would be run by Populists like Rabi Lamichanne and you know who.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/102b22q/despair_hope_and_no_hope_just_a_distraction_a/,1/3/2023 15:34,4,0,2,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

1bvheyc,Physical Attack in Thamel,"Any Nepali lawyers here?

I (F, foreigner) was physically attacked by a woman in Thamel but I didn’t attain any serious physical injuries. I’ve been coming back and forth to the police station but they’re not taking my case seriously. There is a cctv footage of what happened but all they want me to do is take the apology of the woman that attacked me. 

I personally do not know the woman nor have  met her before. She just started fighting with me by slapping me and all that. I was not drunk either.

I feel like it’s unfair that they don’t wanna do anything about this because I’m a foreigner and it’s a small case. Does that mean I could also go around Kathmandu randomly slapping women I don’t know and get away with it all the time?

Any advice? Thanks.

——

Edit: I did not expect this post to get this much engagements. 😂 Sorry to confuse everyone because of my last paragraph! I was not randomly slapped. My attacker randomly started fighting with me which lead to her physically attacking me. I also did self-defense. This has been escalated to the authorities and is already confirmed as a minor case of physical attack. I wrote out of the frustration that I couldn’t do anything to fight for my basic rights because I have no serious physical injuries. Physical attack is still physical attack.

Thank you for your suggestions and concern. I will stop writing any more details about the incident. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Hope you all have a good day and be safe out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1bvheyc/physical_attack_in_thamel/,4/4/2024 7:46,228,0,159,English,1,1,1,1,0,2

I went to ABC, Shey Phoksundo, Juphal, Nepalgunj, Chitwan, Langtang, Mustang, and many more places without a guide, porter, or a friend. 

I hope this journey inspires others to solo travel (safely), and to open your hearts to new experiences.

With many thanks !

Also, I'm sorry if this question may seem ridiculous to you, I'm just intimated by the regional growth of Islamophobia.

18ynwr1,I think Nepal should face international scrutiny for this,"Me and my gf recently went to Sagarmatha National Park for the Gokyo Lake/Renjo Pass trek - without a porter or guide. Although i love Nepal, the people and the nature here and I have been here many times, I was absolutely shocked by the lack of signs in the region. Mixed with an abundance of pathways and smaller trails it is a definite recipe for disaster. There is no logical reason for there not being any signs and even I - an experienced trekker - found myself in an incredibly dangerous situation multiple times as a result of there not being a single sign for stretches of sometimes 30-40 km. 
I do think the local government bears responsibility for tourism safety and yes, you could say that people could just hire a porter or guide but some people are here for their own personal pilgrimage which I know Nepali people value dearly. I see the lack of signs as a huge danger to visitors and as the park has been open for decades with no one actually doing anything about it, Nepal should face international scrutiny for endangering the lives of its visitors in such a careless manner. I mean, what’s the issue in a sign every 5 kilometers?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18ynwr1/i_think_nepal_should_face_international_scrutiny/,1/4/2024 21:04,192,0,133,English,1,1,0,0,0,2

12cmn3c,Nepal panorama,"A Cultural Panorama on Nepal has been published at[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nepali/goog_2024794708)[https://www.youtube.com/@culturalseries](https://www.youtube.com/@culturalseries)   It is a series of 9 videos under the Cultural Appreciation Series.  For Nepal, each video represents a group, whether it is Newari, Gurung, Sherpa, Madesh, Limbu, or Tharu, with their traditional attire, festivals, and traditions like the Lakhey dance.  All works are illustrated, narrated, and animated by young Nepali artists, with a few guest artists from other countries giving their perspectives on certain aspects.  This initiative not only highlights the culture but also mentors the young artists primarily to develop a starting portfolio to get further work.

For this initiative, a well-known Western rhyme has been reimagined to be happening in Nepal, allowing the illustrator, narrator, and animators to take the audience on an in-depth journey.  The story they have reimagined for Nepal is the nursery rhyme ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" Please check out ""Mary Had a Little Lamb in Nepal"" with the Himalayan mountains and prayer flags as the cover picture. [https://www.yyoutoutube.com/playlist?list=PLlk-\_27LIQsrEbry15jDl-QekMA7ikf30](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlk-_27LIQsrEbry15jDl-QekMA7ikf30)

It is not just made for kids, even though the name might suggest that. The rhyme allowed Mary to travel across Nepal with her lamb and tell her view.  In each picture, Mary is wearing attire from a different group and you can see how the art is made through the time-lapse.

Please subscribe, like and comment and encourage the Nepali artist who created this work. You will be very proud. The world does not know that pagoda style and thangka art spread worldwide from Nepal. The world is unaware of the fabulous structures of Lumbini, Nepal. My kid's eyes opened wide with pride when I showed her the Universal Peace Sanctuary and the Janaki Temple. I hope to discuss all this further in this group. Thank you

Meanwhile, a raffle is going on to be pulled on April 7th for an artist's painting.  Please enter the raffle by subscribing.

Did anyone hike the ABC before by themselves? If so, how did you manage to find accommodation? Are they usually just by the trail? Or do you have to take a detour to find them? Were you able to book them in advance?

Edit 2: A huge update!

A huge thanks to the Reddit and Discord community members who have helped me with the funds and prayed for the betterment of my mom's health. My heart wants to meet all these people in real life and thank them so much for helping me without even knowing me. 

I had zero hopes when I had no money and a mother lying in bed with cancer. Thanks to you all, I have gathered some funds to help my mother, and so far, I have collected **2,57,000** through your love and support. However, My doctor has said it's going to cost more, but I know I will be able to make it through and see my mother all happy and healthy. I hope your beautiful soul will keep helping me to collect more funds and share them with every community you know. Even a rupee is so valuable for me at the moment that any amount of money is a blessing for me!  
My mother also thanks all of the people for helping out. I know when she will be healthy she will be reading out all of these comments and cry out of happiness. Love you all!  
I hope the mods of this community will pin my post so more people will be able to help me out!

1cbcbu7,Help for the 4 year child,"**Dear Friends and Supporters,**

Today, I reach out to you with a heavy heart and a hopeful spirit on behalf of a young life in dire need. **Kishan Sada**, a 4-year-old child from the Saptari District, is battling a severe case of **Bilateral Pneumonia with right-sided Empyema**. His condition is critical, and while the operation costs have been generously waived by the BPKIHS institute, the journey ahead remains daunting.

Kishan's family, hailing from a marginalized Dalit community, is struggling to afford the expensive medications required for his recovery. Despite the generous contributions from kind-hearted individuals, the funds are still insufficient. The reality is stark – without these medicines, Kishan's chances of recovery are slim.

We are calling upon your compassion and generosity to help Kishan in this fight for his life. Your financial support could be the beacon of hope that sees this young child through his operation and post-operative care. It could be the difference between life and hardship for Kishan.

Please consider making a donation, no matter how small, to assist in covering the cost of Kishan's medical needs. Your contribution will directly impact his ability to access the necessary treatments and give him a fighting chance at a healthy future.

Let us come together for Kishan, for every child deserves the opportunity to live, thrive, and dream of a brighter tomorrow.

17hrcx6,A note of sadness to u/pailkedv whose kitten died today!,"The death of your kitten is a tragic reminder of the impermanence of all things. Nothing lasts forever, not even our most beloved companions. This can be a difficult truth to accept, but it is also a liberating one. When we know that our time on earth is limited, we are more likely to cherish the moments we have and to live each day to the fullest.

The death of your kitten also raises the question of the meaning of life. If everything is impermanent, what is the point of it all? 

The meaning of life is up to each individual to decide. But one thing is for sure: the death of a loved one can force us to confront this question head-on.

The fact that you were able to care for a 3-week-old kitten suggests that you have the capacity to give and receive love. This is a precious gift. Even though your kitten is gone, you still have the ability to love and be loved by others.

I hope that you can find comfort in the knowledge that your kitten's life was not meaningless. Based on your DMs, it brought you joy and companionship, even if it was only for a short time. And even though its death has caused you great pain, it has also taught you valuable lessons about the impermanence of life and the importance of love...even had a slight healing of insomnia.

I encourage you to grieve the loss of your kitten fully. Allow yourself to feel all of your emotions, both positive and negative. This is an important part of the healing process.

In time, I hope that you will be able to open your heart to love another cat. Your kitten would want you to be happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pokhara/comments/17hrcx6/a_note_of_sadness_to_upailkedv_whose_kitten_died/,10/27/2023 16:24,8,0,0,English,1,0,1,1,0,0

1aw4jtt,"how far must one help a family member in Nepal? Personal situation, please advice","&#x200B;

Hi,  
I am 25 (F) and have a cousin who is 32 (M). I am very frustrated because of my cousin. I have it hard time understanding why someone can be so irresponsible to not get a job in his lifetime. He is now a financial burden to the family, my father who is raising him because he became an orphan sadly.  
I asked him a few days ago why he hasn't gotten a job, he said earning money is not important to him.  
I understand that money isn't everything but we are not like rich people. We have enough to get by but we never have enough for activities like travelling and eating out.  
Nepal ma job paunu garo cha bhan cha. Is this true because dada ko friends ko jobs cha ani beh pani bhako cha.   
All my dad wants is for us to stand on our own two feet and take care of ourselves.  
I got irritated because he asked me to buy him an iPhone and was complaining that his OPPO phone was glitching. Is it right for someone who doesn't value money, and is not taking care of his finances to ask for that? He relies on our 94-year-old grandpa for his pension money which is like 2k in 3 months and my father also gets a pension as he has retired too.  
I find this pathetic because I have worked and earned money to support myself and my parents in some sense. But I hope to earn enough to give back to my parents.  
I find that he is entitled and recently I had to chip in my savings to support him for his hospital surgery bills, along with the pensions combined.  
Now he will have to go through some chemotherapy and I am so frustrated because it's gonna be difficult. Had he had some savings and earnings, he could've helped himself.  
He also got rejections from some marriage prospects because I believe he does not have a job so why would any female or the parents want to give their daughter's hand over to this man?  
Is this Nepali culture? To bend over backs to help the family? while someone is working hard, the other does not and slacks off. im 7 years younger than him   
Daddy even thought he was not going anywhere in life and has begun some construction and building for his future. But that takes money too so there a struggle in that.   
Should I get him the phone? Like I don't understand him. Please help me understand this man",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNepal/comments/1aw4jtt/how_far_must_one_help_a_family_member_in_nepal/,2/21/2024 5:50,1,0,0,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

11gwjil,Alcohol obsessed country,"

OK newars drink culturally and as far as I know, only in festivals but what in the world are the rest of the people doing? Alcohol has some medical uses but only for certain conditions and in a certain quantity. Recreational use ain't medication. 

Alcohol is super expensive here on average, beers cost more than full meals, most people can barely handle their drink, almost no one likes the taste (but they pretend to) and yet there's this obsession, mostly due to Hollywood and Bollywood influence.

I've even seen people who don't drink being called 'boring'. But let's be honest, if you need alcohol to have fun then you don't know how to have fun.. as simple as that. If you need crutches to walk, you ain't a good walker. Very simple isn't it? 

""but it helps me socialize..."" if you need alcohol to socialize, again the solution is to develop social skills, not be dependent on this filth. Why is this depressant which will only damage your brain, liver and wallet being glorified? Don't let the west or anyone fool you into thinking we need this filth.

Our paths to greater goals are denied not by obstacles, but by smaller goals. Happiness/enjoyment are greater goals and drinking this toxicity is the smaller goal that will never let you reach the larger goals.

zd7ow9,Effective way to get rid of alcohol abuse?,"Hey everyone, coming straight to point my mom abuses alcohol and for the past 5-6 years she has been doing so. drinking is her bad habit as far as i know(though she is really outgoing and sweet). she tried smoking and bd but left soon after. My family earnings is decent and family runs by. My mom has been to rehab center twice once was on narconin and second time was on some cheap rehab center in a hope that she will leave this habit of her, but all of it went to vain.

first rehab was around 3 years ago and the second was around a year ago. also i think its worth mentioning that my mom once had seizure because of alcohol withdraw which was around the same time she was sent to second rehab center. she had been there for 6 months and after her dispatch she left drinking for about a month. but because of her bad influence friends she got hooked to alcohol. and till this date she has been consuming it with very few rare days of going without alcohol. in such cases her temper usually rises, tries to run away from home, hands start getting shaky.

finally i decided to take initiative and for the past 1 weeks i have been providing her with small dose of alcohol (20rs local rakshi. i think its around 100ml or something)  in a hope to get her cravings low. i have been successful enough to control her drinking habits because previously she used to drink from as soon 1 in the evening however for the past 1 week i give her small dose before she goes to sleep and luckily enough she listens to me.

However today while she was washing her clothes her hand got bent suddenly and the hand seems to be swollen. unfortunately i was not present at the moment and the only thing i see is her swollen hand. i am afraid if decreasing the dose is effecting her in some ways or am i doing something wrong by giving her alcohol in the first place. not providing her alcohol makes the situation even worse and i am scared if she will have a second seizure. i was planning to gradually decrease the dose and i went from 50rs rakshi to all the way 20rs. She does still crave for alcohol but i was curious enough to know if there is some way i could replace her craving with another less lethal craving.

I am so sorry if this was long but i just wanted to cover everything that's going on and suggestion would be really appreciated. what will be the most effective way for me to get rid of her addiction. Also while she was at rehab they provided her with sleeping pills and fludep-10 saying she was depressed but i know for a fact that my mom isn't. could it have been the prime cause of her not leaving her addiction? should i switch to medicine? i am afraid to do so as her both immune system and physical body seems to be at a very dire situation.

I am hoping someone can help or suggest a way out here. I am positing on behalf of a friend who is directly dealing through a substance abuse in the family. A family member of hers has been through rehab multiple times but it only seems to work for a while. I am unsure what the trigger is (if there is any) but the person goes back to drinking again. He has kids who are being taken care of by the family. 

The situation has gotten so worse that the family cannot afford paying for rehab out of their pocket and they cannot just have him stay at home and drink 24x7 as it will have  impact on the kids that are around. After going through this for more than a decade and having explored all options they know, they are looking for a way out. 

They want the person to be taken out of the house where he can be looked at and hopefully better himself. 

Do you guys know of any organization who takes care of these people and would be willing to help?

Please do not provide any judgemental or harsh comments. I am sure the family member will be reading this as well.

1fz59ae,"Tea on Paradygm TV, the youtube channel. ","I got recommended their video of Sujan Zimba and Sydney Gurung, when I clicked on their channel, i saw the views, it has gone disastrous except for this video.  I might know the reason why. 

Back then, when it was run by Sisan Baniya himself, it used to be a huge thing, 

I joined as an ""intern"". No contracts, No JD. highly unprofessional. The ""top"" guys are literally alcoholic, stoner and borderline creep(Some are at the top of creep tier list). The conversations of content plan revolve around  ""Ramri Keti lai Rakshi khuwaney"". Therefore this video. The conversations in the office are such filth and mysoginistic. Putting girls on thumbnail isn't a big thing. But ""leader"" sexualizing their guests was beyond what I had ever expected of the team. 

Nothing productive happens there. Meeting are blame game. ""Leader"" is clueless about anything and everything. No Managerial Skill. 

I was not even provided with how much salary I would get. ""Kaam herera diney"". When I talked with other employees, it was the same case. Those who were there for a longer time were literally ""exploited"".  Longer work hours and pennies in return. 

One person there is straight up an asshole. Supposed to be a leader but was mostly drunk or stoned (observational). Sisan Baniya has a different team. I can't say about them. But I am so happy on the downfall of Paradygm TV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fz59ae/tea_on_paradygm_tv_the_youtube_channel/,10/8/2024 17:20,252,0,28,English,0,1,0,0,0,2
17rwwvx,The Fall of Men,"Didn't think I'd have to include this as a disclaimer, but by ""men"" in the title I don't mean the gender as a whole but a rather large subset of it that is slowly drowning because of the societal structure and failure to embrace changes in recent years.

This thread is somewhat less relevant in the context of Nepal but in this age of globalization, it is still some thing to be concerned about. There are almost equal number of men and women, both in Nepal and in the world. (Nepal's sex ratio is 95 men per 100 women but let's assume 100). We have come from a time where it was normal for a wife to be burnt alive with her dead spouse, to today, but not every aspect of this change is as dandy.

*This thread is NOT an attack on women and an attempt to provoke men to violent measures. It is merely an observation from a subjective viewpoint. You are free to argue with your own opinions. In fact I'd love to hear your opinions on this matter.*

In the past, men were the sole breadwinners of a family, while a woman was bound to be a housewife. They had no right to vote, no right to the labour market, but after the industrial revolution, worker exploitation began to drop some and then the feminists rose up to ensure their rights. ""To be treated equal"" was the main motto. But is it really where we are headed?

Let's talk about woman's role in relationship for a second. In the past, when patriarchy was definitely prevalent (Edit: I do not endorse the past one bit, people seem to misunderstand that) , men would still go out of their way to impress a woman because that would mean she's giving him herself with her full heart. In order to avoid conflict that might arise from feelings of love, the elders set up monogamy, so that everyone has a right to be with someone who treasures them like no other. But then later female promiscuity rose through the roof. ""Marriage"", a concept that binds two people for life, started to fall apart like it was just another fling. And I am only pointing out a portion of the population here, this obviously doesn't apply to everyone.

Two powers cannot coexist in the same realm unless they complement each other. Modern feminism has pitted men against women, which was never the real objective of the initial movement. The psychological aspect of men and women makes it so that there are some things a man will excel at as compared to a woman, and some other things where a woman would outperform a man. Just like STEM is mostly men and HEAL is mostly women. We shouldn't assume everything to be a stereotype and let our own masculine/feminine energy drive us forward.

""As long as they're happy"" is one way to look at it. But now that both genders are on equal footing on everything else, it wouldn't be right to be putting anyone on a pedestal. The internet and social media as exacerbated this to an extreme extent. The volatile mind of girls is easily attracted to the newest ""trends"" and ""gossips"" around the internet, which has created a whole subgroup of women who can now offer their body for a price, without even having to be a pr\*stitute. The economy now is based on services and products, and the service they seem to offer is gratification in the form of pleasure. I can't believe how lucrative this business has become for anyone now to offer a sneak of something they were born with, with nothing else at play. I recently read a news story about a minor who recently turned 18 and got an OnlyFans. Her reported monthly earnings for a single month was 18 million dollars. An amount someone could easily retire with, never having to think about working after that.

While I brought this up, I don't actively advocate against this partly because in the capitalist economy, a person can go down to any level for a substantial profit. I don't blame women for finding ways to become filthy rich by doing essentially nothing that helps the world in any way. The much bigger part of the problem is how the men have gotten weaker with time. While women are taking what should be theirs, a big chunk of men are retreating from their own self. I'm indifferent to the polyamory that is placing its roots in the society today. I'm not in a position to tell someone what to do with their life.

I found an interesting statistic from a research. The findings were that 30% of women were single for a certain age group, while the number was 60% for men. We can clearly see the disparity here, and there can only be one explanation. So what was women empowerment really for? To take power away from men, or to weaken a big part of a gender to centralize the power on a select few who couldn't care less? I support empowerment wholeheartedly, but are we going about it the right way?

A US census report found that 30-40% of women are the breadwinners of their family in the US now. And similar proportion of women earn more than their male counterparts. While this statistic may look uplifting, it is also imperative to note the notion that western woman (or women everywhere, not sure) carry, ""My money is my money, his money is our money"". This, coupled with the fact that women are inherently attracted to men with a higher status than them, has now become a solid reason of steadily rising divorce rates in the country and in the world in general.

Let's move the topic away from women here. The whole economy is set up to profit from this weakening state of the male psyche. All the social media subscription mechanisms, that hook these victims of their own inefficacy fall even further by shoving down influencers' lives which they endlessly scroll through after a whole day of cleaning the public restrooms for less than minimum wage. We are now reverting back to the era of slavery where the exploited labourers of the past are the current ""lonely men"". The economy is built to falter whatever self worth they have and weaken the emotional state to the point that they would do anything just to get that hit of dopamine. The adult entertainment industry, lazy video gaming industry, social media and internet as a whole is stripping young men out of adrenaline, serotonin and testosterone and slowly turning them into living zombies. This has been a very profitable business for the elites.

Basically, they are selling hopelessness for a steep price.

In other statistics, the su\*cide rate for men is twice that of women, that is not a small margin. 1.5% of all deaths in the world is just men ending their own lives. Let's not discount the indirect su\*cides caused by alcohol, drugs and smoking, all of which, in most cases are the indirect outcome of a weak psyche. Genetically, men are more likely to prefer spending time alone as compared to women. Even though in our culture, females have been told to be shut-ins and quiet, it has been observed that the level of introversion in both genders is nearly identical, which means the assumed ""dominant"" male population is just as shut in as the assumed ""suppressed"" female population. If you've never heard of ""Hikikomori"", it's a social phenomenon in Japan where young guys have completely given up on life and stay inside their own room/apartment with nobody else without any kind of social interaction until they die untimely because life expectancy is closely and inversely related with loneliness. It is also one of the reasons why women in general have a higher life expectancy than men.

My implication here is not to create a gender divide but to embrace the differences that come with being a certain sex. I don't have a magical solution that will solve this issue. If I had, I would probably be shot dead tomorrow because that could reduce the influence that the world leaders have on the general population right now. Humanity is going through the greatest identity crisis it has ever seen, and I hope we emerge as a mature civilization when this ends.

I forgot what else I had in mind, so let's keep it at this for now. Maybe I'll continue some other time?

Please do leave your honest opinions here. I still have a lot to learn about the situation and I hope you guys can inform me if my views don't align with yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/17rwwvx/the_fall_of_men/,11/10/2023 5:15,0,0,129,English,0,1,1,0,1,2
1bmlp8x,Wrong touches during Holi,"Crowded places just seem like a place of opportunity for some men apparently.

Today I and my family were at Bhrikuti Mandap for Holi celebration. At around 2 when we were leaving the venue, me and my sister were near the gate, waiting for others to meet us there and for our brothers who were fetching our rides. 

Me and my sister were talking face to face about something when a group of four guys passed by us, my back facing them. The first guy touched my sister's cheek in a gesture of putting colors and yelled ""Happy Holi"". Me and my sister froze for a second as it came out of nowhere. When I was about to react, the fourth guy in the same group did the same. This happened in a matter of 3 seconds. 

Now, for what's wrong with this interaction?

1. We knew none of the guys, let alone acknowledge them as they were passing by us. Yes, many strangers tend to put color on you for Holi but these two? THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY COLOR ON THEIR HANDS! My sister's cheeks were washed and clean and their cheek swipe left NO COLOR on her hence, it was not a friendly ""Happy Holi Stranger"" touch. It was an intentional ""I will touch that pretty girl for no reason"" touch which is NOT acceptable.
2. They had the audacity to do this without an ounce of shame or regard to the fact that my sister wasn't even alone I WAS WITH HER STANDING LESS THAN A FEET AWAY and the place had lots of people around. 
3. My sister was not comfortable with the touch at all. If anything, she was disgusted. Even if it wasn't intentional as some may put it, her being uncomfortable is a reason enough to acknowledge an unwanted touch from a stranger no matter how small.
4. Many may say the guys may have been under influence of bhaang or alcohol. I DON'T CARE. No matter the state of mind, if you were conscious enough to walk into that venue and do this, YOU ARE CONCIOUS ENOUGH TO KNOW IT'S WRONG.

I wasn't able to do anything because it took me a moment to comprehend the situation as it was my first time experiencing something like this with my sister. They were gone in seconds and way before we made sense of what happened out of nowhere. When I did come to my senses, all I wanted to do was slap them and make them apologize; not being able to do so being my biggest regret.

I am not posting this here to hear anyone defending those guys or say that I' over-reacting because I'm not. My sister was touched against her will, she did not like it, I did not like it and that's that. No matter how small, it was a wrong touch and letting these slide makes things a bigger issue. It wasn't my first time experiencing it during Holi but seeing it happen to my sister right in front of my eyes and I couldn't do anything, it was a real eye-opener.

 It's a reminder for my dear ladies to be careful of these things and REACT to it rather than letting it slide. And for the males, please refrain from such action even if your intention isn't bad. It makes us uncomfortable, and we always know if it was intentional or not.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1bmlp8x/wrong_touches_during_holi/,3/24/2024 14:12,92,0,65,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

1ez4lca,Food Identification for a Previous Visitor,"To start off, I lived in Nepal about 6 years ago for a handful of months, about half of the time I resided in Kathmandu, the other half I lived in Ilam. I tried many dishes, which to my dismay I cannot find anything close to in the US, except for Indian food, which is good, but not quite the same for the nostalgia and comfort that Nepalese food brought me. I am looking to identify a food I did not enjoy, but has been bugging me that I cannot find any info about it online. I had it once or twice while visiting a local family's home for dinner. I do not know the name, but I can describe the texture, look, and flavor ⬇️

For looks (it could be prepared differently as well I would assume) It was white, and looked like a very silky tofu that was cut into small cubes. It was served in a small dish on a dal bhat platter, and had some kind of clear, maybe green liquid leaking from it. Presumably what it was cooked in, or stored in.

Texture was very similar to tofu again, but soft like the kind you would find in a soup. Similar to a soft set jello or the fat that coagulates after cooking chicken with a bit more resistance when you bite into it.

Taste was the part that absolutely wrecked my taste buds for a bit, but is the part that I cannot get out of my head. It was SO bitter to my taste buds, and tasted like nail polish remover, or rubbing alcohol. There was an underlying flavor as well but I cannot remember since it has been so long. 

If you recognize this food please let me know the name! And or let me know what it was, most of the food I ate while at a household for a meal, I never questioned and just ate.

12quxyz,Jaari (Appreciation/Review post),"Appreciation Post 
“Jaari” with the start of the the new year 2080. I went to watch the movie on the second day expecting a good movie as it was dayahang movie. Nonetheless, the movie was not only good but i will call it rate it as one of the top 5 movies of Nepali Film Industry.
Starting with the cinematography,
 the potrayal of the eastern nepal is uncanny (i can assure you with that as myself being from the eastern nepal). There is beautiful scene at the end with dayahang rai and Miruna magar with a long shot taken in the green hillside with still remains with me. 
Potrayal of the eastern culture, 
the movie is based on the limbu culture or i should say the kirant culture. The director have done an excellent job on including every small details about the rituals and culture with perfection. the scene of palam is what i consider as the cherry on the top of the movie. The wide shot was probably taken on the real event or the film crew have done an excellent job on replicating it.
Background score and music, 
through out the year what i have ibserved is that nepali movies don’t quite have the understanding on the importance of good background score for the movie. But while watching jaari i can say the maker have put quite an effort on creating the perfect background score and music for the movie. Me personally growing up with dads cds and cassettes there were loads of eastern culltural songs and videos, i became quite fond of them. While listening the palam song it was both nostalgic and sweet to the ears. the music is the second best thing about the movie.
Performance by the actors, 
i already knew dayahang rai is one of the most capable actors of the industry and expected him to do great in this as well and i thought he would be the spot light of the movie but i was wrong. The spotlight is taken by Miruna Magar and only her. Every scene which included her seemed so natural. She wholly took the character and made it her own. Really loved her performance. And all other actors too, everyone has done a great job. I see in most of the nepali movies the side actors seems as if they are forced to do it, but with jaari i would say every actor did their best and never let the audience feel like they were acting. Really loved the miruna’s brothers character would love to see him with major roles in future movies
Attention to detail, 
throughout the movie i observed the little things which were like little chocolate chips inside a cake, small but tasty. These attention to small things made the film more beautiful. For example, the scene where miruna’s character is eating soil representing the common belief of pregnent woman craving for soil or the scene with the preparation of alcohol, or the dikki scene or the oil extracting scene. All these small details are like small little gems of a beautiful ornament.
Also i would like to mention the last scene when dayahang rai sings palam for getting miruna with the words recited by his deceased mother, the intensity in that scene matched the intensity of the scene from Kabbadi 2 when dayahang rai walks off after the fight with saugat malla.
What could have been better?
Yes who am i to say what could have been better for this beautiful movie but this is what i think could have been made the movie even more beautiful than it is now that is the character played Roydeep Shrestha shoudl have given more screen time and abit background of his character.

Overall i loved the movie. Really appreciate the work of Upendra Subba. I suggest everyone to go watch it. It will be a experience",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/12quxyz/jaari_appreciationreview_post/,4/18/2023 16:31,62,0,43,English,0,0,0,1,0,1
1932va5,Being Normal Isn't Special,"You aren't Special

You might listen or see nowadays people are like: ""I don't Smoke😌"" they tend to think not smoking is something special and powerful and they are being different from the rest of the population by not smoking, they are special and they are doing something which is not normal in society 

When not smoking and drinking alcohol is just being normal, You don't drink ans smoke? Then congratulations you get in the category of ""Normal person"" you don't have a tag or crown for the ""Not smoking and drinking work""

People who smoke and drink are abnormal people's cause we aren't made to inhale the toxins by ourselves inside our body and if the person who used to smoke all time stop taking it then there is nothing to think big about him, he just became a normal human nothing more don't glamorise that

 Is it something to flex about? No, being normal isn't a thing to flex

I also heard people saying ""We gOooo GymMmm"" bro that's normal, you're doing normal things which every human should do but somehow they aren't doing, how can basic works like going to the gym can be flex? It's a normal thing to go to the gym, my nearest house dudh wala pasal ko uncle always goes to the gym but never flex about it

And some random aesthetic, tiktok dudes are like:""BrO I CaN cO0k😏"",  so what? It is a basic survival skill which every human should have, there is nothing to flex about having a survival skill and it's totally normal to know how to cook

 That's something which everyone should have

Having basic skills and doing usual things which every humans should do and should be doing is a flex for us, such a society we are living in

We have been too lazy and doomed these days that these basic things like not smoking, not drinking and doing usual stuff like going gym and cooking is a flex how far our society has gone 

I don't know why people are flexing every normal things these days, daily task garda ni flex garcha k ho bujnai sakinna",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1932va5/being_normal_isnt_special/,1/10/2024 7:41,0,0,32,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

etbql7,About Corona,"(Recent updates at the end of the post)

Prevention?
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the thrash.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects.
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.
- N95 masks have some chance to be effective. Unclear if they will be truly effective against this virus. No evidence that inexpensive masks will prevent virus particles to be inhaled. 
- No vaccine to prevent it yet. 

Symptoms?
- Fever.
- Respiratory Issues - Difficulty in breathing, shortness of breathe, coughing.
- Chest x-ray shows signs of pneumonia in both lungs.
- Kidney failure.
- Symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 after exposure. 

Diagnosis?
- The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is sending your samples for a lab test. From what I have read, we’re dependent on WHO lab in Hong Kong for this. 

If you go see a doctor, tell them following:
- Where you have been travelling and living.
- If you have had direct contact with animals (for example, visited a live animal market).
- If you have had close contact with a sick person, especially if they had fever, cough or difficulty breathing

Update 01/08: 
- A company I work for in Bay Area US along with multiple well known companies are now taking extreme measures by asking the employees who are traveling in from countries where Corona case has been confirmed, which unfortunately includes our country, to continue working for home for at least 2 weeks.
-  Officially, China death toll surpasses 700, official global death toll set to surpass that of SARS. 
- Most of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Across mainland China, the number of cases stood at 31,744 as of today.
- Two deaths have been reported outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and Philippines. Both are Chinese nationals. 
- To help you understand how the infectious disease like Corona has no limits, the latest patient includes British nationals staying at a ski cabin in Southeastern France. They stayed in same ski resort cabin with a person who has been in Singapore. Officials say they are not in serious condition.

ntfret,One king gone and 100 king came,"HIT & RUN CASE ALERT‼️

A man has died in Biratnagar on Thursday evening after being hit by a car driven by Rabin Karki, son of Province 1 Member of Parliament (MP) Bindiya Karki. According to local eyewitnesses, two other girls were also in the car. All three persons got out of the car and fled immediately after the accident, all of them appeared to have consumed alcohol. The deceased has been identified as an Indian citizen, Mukesh Sharma, 35. Similarly, another 24-year old Ram Kumar Rajbanshi of Katahari RM-2 sustained critical injuries in the accident. He is undergoing treatment at Nobel Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar.

Robin Karki along with two other girls fled the scene immediately after the incident occurred, eyewitnesses said. However, police have not yet confirmed if Robin  Karki was driving the car even after eyewitnesses confirmed it was him. Police said they are investigating the case and have launched a manhunt to nab Karki.

Note: If it wasn't the case related to MP then the perpetrators would have already been behind the bar by now. The thing is, people have seen the accident, there are eyewitnesses; so the accused should be taken action according to the law. This case shouldn't go like Prithivi Malla Hit & Run Case. The Supreme Court (SC) had released Prithvi Malla, 21 of Gothatar, Kathmandu, who had killed a pedestrian while driving under influence and ran away, on bail of Rs 500,000. He was released on bail citing that he suffers from severe depression and asthma. Prithivi Malla belongs to an elite Malla family.

1e6ys52,A question about prices in bars and restaurants,"Hey guys, just to premise/frame this I should say that I’m not upset about this but curious. 

I notice that I’ll go to a nice restaurant, get two craft beers and a meal and it’ll cost me about 2,000R. Then I’ll go to a corner shop and buy 3 craft beers and it costs me about 2,000R Local beer also costs about 1,500 in a shop. Is this because:

1. alcohol is really expensive compared to food

2. restaurants don’t mark up drinks so much so.
3. People in shops just make up the price of things depending on what they think you’ll pay and they just guess I won’t care whereas restaurants have menus so can’t 

I await your wisdom

18wq6yt,Living With Schrizohernic Person,"My mom have been suffering from schizophrenia from decades but medication was helping her and nothing was wrong

But she decided to go to Kathmandu later and she again suffered from it (she got her first attack after many years) and then my sister's treated her for weeks

And after treatment and lot of medication she was good, she came to home and I saw her outside damn my mom's last smile I saw :) on her face, she was smiling all good having good time with her people around our house (chimeki)

And later she again got Schrizohernic  and that was the time all problem again started: I was giving her medication every day but nothing is working: we consulted with doctor he said to change the medicine we did but yeah still no changes

She speak whatever she wants, she think everyone as suspicious in our house (who live in rent) and even after eating 2 pcs of sleeping tabs she don't sleep throughout the night and however through the night (I haven't slept since few weeks due to this)

She often thik me as suspicious and ask me where I was: (she think I go somewhere to drink alcohol and smoke) ps: in real I don't even drink coke 

I get that she is in her world; she is disconnected from reality, she doesn't have consciousness of whatever she is thinking, she has random thoughts which is affecting her daily life, I get that but it still break you from inside even as a man seeing your mom behaving like a psycho person who used to do be  good

Sitting all day home taking care of her and coming home after going out for sometime (your brain was fresh and you were feeling good) and suddenly you come to your home and your emotion and mental state starts being parallel with your mom's behaviour

You think negative all the time, you fear if she kill herself, you listen to her every bad words she call by you and reply normally damn it feels so hard

11nubg8,Restaurants Scam in Kathmandu,"I regularly go to different restaurants with friends. Previously I used to Pay after I have some food without cross checking the menus. But one time I had few bucks with me and I ordered food with my budget. I ordered chicken taas. Later during billing, the amount was different than I expected and I argued with the owner. She told me something that I still can't imagine.

The conversation between me and her was something like this :
Me: yo ta menu maa vako Vanda dherai price vo ta
She : chicken ko pieces haru pani dherai pathai deko thiyo ni ta.
Me: Aani hamile ta menu anushar tirne ho ta.. Thapai haru le tesai j mann laagey tehi bill nikalna milxa? 
She: Kati kich kich garira jabo yettiko lagi. La teti nai dinu.

This happened a year ago... I shared this incident with my friends. After that I became aware that restaurants tend to scam the customers into billing more than the menu. Today also I was almost scammed. An item in the bill was Rs. 50 more than the menu. I argued with the waiter and he said that the menu is now changed. It was an old price? Hoina restaurant haru le menu maa price update garna chutaako ki customers haru lai thagne bahana matra ho?

189mhbf,you are not special - mark manson,"this paragraph is from the mark manson book "" the subtle art of not giving a f\*ck "" aafule padeko share garam vanera share gareko hai........  
 Therapist Lori Gottlieb’s memoir discusses the fact that sometimes, a person who’s going through difficulty in life can’t move past it until they stop seeing their problems as unique or exceptional. In one example that she relates to illustrate this, a woman with a history of alcoholism (prompted by an abusive marriage) is unable to forgive herself for her past mistakes—she feels like she has messed up her life in a unique way and that her mistakes are worse than other people’s. She’s therefore unable to get involved in a new (healthier) romantic relationship. She can only move forward when she accepts that her struggles are similar to millions of other people’s struggles.   


Another of Gottlieb’s examples shows the opposite type of exceptionalism: A man who thinks he’s smarter than everyone around him continually causes problems in his relationships until he accepts that he isn’t special, either.   
These examples show that feelings of exceptionalism can work in both ways—they can hold people to pain that they think is special, or they can hold people to feelings of superiority that prevent meaningful relationships. It’s only when a person recognizes that they’re *not* exceptional (and that that’s okay), that they can make progress in treatment and in their lives.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/189mhbf/you_are_not_special_mark_manson/,12/3/2023 5:23,27,0,10,Roman & English,0,0,0,1,0,1

16tprmp,Cigarettes as a replacement to friendship,"First of all let me make this clear, I am not endorsing this idea in any way. This is just my little rant.

If in case this one gets longer than I initially planned, there will be a tl;dr at the end.

I never thought I would turn out this way. Even though my exams are at their peak right now, I still couldn't shake this thing from my head and had to make a full rant about it for some probably ocd-ish reason. This wasn't the me I was visualizing as a child. In fact I never had a vision of future me as a kid. People as younglings apparently have this rough idea of what kind of person they want to be as they grow up but I never could give it a thought. Even when I would consciously want to think about that, all that would come to mind is ""thulo manxe banne ho"". Nothing more, no willingness to think further. And no I wasn't the ""live in the present"" kind of person either. Now that I look back in retrospect, I was essentially devoid of the whole concept of time. I was neither living in the present, nor thinking about later, and I definitely don't remember much about my past because I've been so absentminded throughout my childhood. Currently I can't even wrap my head around how my thought process would have been as a kid. All I have as ""memories"" are the marksheets that say I got 95 or whatever percentages in elementary grade but I don't remember shit about all those years. It's to a point where I'm inclining towards a belief that I have dementia of some kind.

But leaving that part of the story, I am here now. Doing undergrad in whatever subject I could get my name out in, without having a clear desire in anything at all. At the end of grade 12, I was given two choices; well there was only one but I could decide to not take the choice. The choice was made by literally everyone around me. My studies had led me to this point. A decent SEE grade along with a +2 in Bio could only mean one thing: MBBS. But that was probably when I started to get a grip on myself. Where was I? What was I doing all along? The realization finally hit me that I was so far behind everyone. When I talked to my the-then colleagues in grade 12 about what they'd do right after, they'd have an effortless answer at their disposal but I'd have to take a pause to think but then make something up my arse because I sincerely had no clue. When presented with the only option, I started thinking, researching possible career options and all but nothing got me intrigued at all. I started to imagine what life would be like if I studied MBBS. I couldn't see myself being able to handle the heat. So I looked at the only relevant alternative (at least to the Nepali eye), engineering.

Despite not actually having a clear interest in anything, I could at least dampen the horrors of my would-be future as a doctor, whose weight of profession I as a person, am not built to withstand, or so I thought, I'd never know at least. I probably even asked here in this subreddit about which of the new options to choose. I couldn't give a thought to going abroad though. I saw a ton of my classmates, childhood friends and basically 50% of who I know of my generation, just fly soon after +2 ended. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was too scared. I couldn't convince my family even if I tried. I wasn't mature enough, not ready by far. So I stayed. Maybe in the next 4 years I will be ready, is what I said to myself.

Maybe in the next 4 years, I would build myself a support system to be able to sustain outside. Maybe I'd garner enough of the skills I lack to finally fit in with the international standards. Maybe I would have a robust network by the end of those years whom I could rely on in case I had some turmoil.

I had never tried alcohol before grade 11, and by the end of that grade, I tried it for the first time, and I didn't drink my second glass until 1 year later. Maybe that was just me opening up. Liquor was an idea I had not rejected even as a kid, well a teen. With classmates, we'd talk about how alcohol is fine, sometimes hookah isn't too bad but never in my life will I pick up a cigarette. And everyone agreed back then. Perhaps I was the only one who broke that vow, maybe everyone did. I'm not in touch with them as much currently to know the real answer to that. But after grade 12 ended and it was time for me to join the preparation classes for medical entrance, I had my first puff. If it was your friends whose company made you do such you would call it ""peer pressure"" but for me I had my first one with one of my relatives. So let's call it ""blood pressure"". Quirky, I know.

And off I headed to the capital of Nepal, and by some luck and will, I stayed with the same relative during my time there, since they were already doing a course in a college in ktm. During that time, I had become a regular. At some point during the beginning, I remember myself counting the number of cigs I would take because I didn't want that number to cross 100 in my life or something. I had only taken it up as a form of recreation. But soon the company I had turned it into an addiction. The engineering and medical entrances went by and surely, my rank in both would lean me towards engineering. In the very first week, I had found a circle to smoke in. At this point I hadn't realized and maybe I even wasn't addicted. I'd have a cig once every few days and sometimes go weeks without any. Even in my whole first year, I didn't average more than 2/3 per week. But as I entered the second, holy shit. I can't even remember at what point I started keeping packets upon packets in my room because somehow I needed to burn one before I went to sleep. What was an entirely social event for me had suddenly become my friend in the darkness. At 1/2 am right before sleep, after getting the hit I would finally be able to sleep like a log. Before the second year, it was a medium for me to socialize which would normally be not possible, even more so with me lacking so many essential interpersonal skills of communication, empathy, charm and reliability. I liked that about the occasional smokes, that it would create some bondings.

Now at this time and stage, I have been thrown back to the ground with the same lack of intimacy with anyone, an overarching feeling of being left alone all the while having a long paper stick in my hand that seems to rid me of all those thoughts for some minutes and help me calm down. It doesn't talk to me. It certainly doesn't listen to me, but it does exactly what I want it to do. Give me the warmth that I've now starting to believe I'm incapable of experiencing from somewhere else. And it does that because I set it on fire. It feels like I'm a sadist when we try to personify a cig but I don't have schizophrenia so that wouldn't bother me much. It feels like it has become my cane without me realizing anything. At what point did I turn into this person? Was I always like this?

I'm going home after exams end, and I won't have these things in my hands as frequently when I'm there but I can't believe I turned from this person who used to hate the smell of smoke with passion, and every single person who took up a cig, to a person whose day is not complete without it. Sooner or later I will get rid of this, but the bigger issue here is a lack of social skills and this utter manifestation of a 0 EQ being lagging behind everyone in every aspect of life.

This friendship will break too, just like everything else before. But with all said and done, I see a very grim walk of life ahead. This makes me even more scared of going out of country than I was when I finished +2.

Wow I didn't think it would be this long. Guess I just went with a stream instead of just the flow.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Used to hate smoking and smokers, started having puffs to improve social life, now the only friend I have is this piece of paper with crushed dried leaves inside.

15p5r2l,And I'm surrounded by red ones.,"Idk why the hell my life is designed like this. As per my mom, my mom's father used to be drunkard and beat his wife. My mom's mother struggled a lot to raise her five children. My mom's father stopped drinking and beating after my mom's brother once hold his neck and threaten to beat him to death if he repeats it. My mom's brother got DV then settled in US then my mom's father didn't dare to beat her wife.

My mom had an arrange marriage at the age of 20. My grandfather and father came to her house and liked her for marriage. My mom's side family were relatively poorer than my dad side so probably they thought she would be happy in wealthier family. But here comes the irony, she is leading the same life as her mother was living helplessly. The difference is her father used to drink and beat her wife, but my father beats her wife without drinking. I despise my dad to the moon and back. He has dominating personality and wants everything according to him. My mother does her work slower and messy. My father has electric shops but running in loss. My twin brothers were born shortly after I passed my SEE. My mother thought he would stop beating once she would give birth to boy. She was advised to obtain a divorce by aunt, maternal uncle, and me, but she is holding out hope that he may change like her father did.

My father wakes up at 4, does his yoga, worship for hours and goes to shop. Every two months or as often as he feels like it, he hits his wife. He once beat mother for disagreeing his opinion of transferring my brothers to so called sanskrit school which is costlier turned out not even sanskrit. My mother thought changing school would affect their studies and eventually that happened. He hits his wife for an absurd cause out of exasperation and for being messy. He used to have affair back then when I was in grade 5, but my mother forgave him and move on. Three years ago, at 10 p.m, he came home drunk and wanted to talk about extending the business, but I was having my period, so I declined. Then, following their dispute, he started hitting my mother. When I tried to stop, he also started striking me. After that, we complained to the police, but all they did was made my father sign a document promising not to hit again. He doesn't feel guilty for whatever he is doing and had beaten her repeatedly after that.  My dad's side of family is always in favor of him because they don't share good bond with my mother and grandfather is never satisfied with my mother work whatever she does and fully support his son for beating his wife. They think it is okay to beat wife and grown up children. Since then, I started earning for my own, studying as well and ignoring relatives and not talking to them. He started worshipping God, doing yoga, left alcohol and is vegetarian now but doesn't change his nature of beating his wife.  We complained to police after that but all they do is made him sign in agreement paper. Recently, the police said you need to go for court and file against him for domestic violence, but mom disagreed. She is waiting until next time.

And I ended up with pervert one and ignored red flags. The thing is it is in my gene to make red saree with those flags. And there are many stories like this around me which can't be expressed in page and all those are stories running inside Kathmandu Valley and in educated family.

k8fnak,Do you guys think Ganja should be legalized in Nepal?,"Hi fellow Redditors, yall probably know by now that weed is going to be legalized (I don't really much know just seen some posts from verified and trusted news sources in Facebook).

 So in that context, I wanted to ask you redditors(aka the big brainers of Nepal) what you think about the decision made by our Government. Was it right? Was it good to prioritize the economic benefit over someone's bad addiction? How can you assure that the teens won't be addicted to these?

I want you guy's thoughts on this matter. Anyways below are my thoughts on both legalization and not to legalize them.

Thoughts on legalization: Anyways my thoughts are they should be legalized but the transaction should be done with very very much precaution unlike the ''Corona Virus Precaution'' which is complete Kuku outta Buku. Even if its legalized it shouldn't be legal for under 18. Another main thing is  its a good initiative to open new economic gateway for Nepal. Local brand alcohol drink and Ganja can make Nepal a economically strong country if a good system for production, quality assurance and safe trade is ensured by government.  It should be regulated and taxed like any other industry. Alcohol is legal but you hardly see drunken people on the streets. Same with marijuana. But besides getting intoxicated like alcohol, marijuana plant can be used to make ropes, fiber for clothes, paper etc. And we all know other medicinal and home made recipes of the plant.  It should be regulated and taxed like any other industry. 

Thoughts on not legalization: They shouldn't be legal because more teens will get addicted to it since it will be more openly available and even if it is illegal for under 18, the people above 18 will probably sell it to them right? After all money is all that matters right? Another main reason are the dumb kids(yea you heard me right) those attention hungry, ""Ganja khanae kids are the cool kids"" type ko kta kt haru like these kinda kids provoke it to be stay illegal. Lastly, I think that it should be legalized after 20-30 years since then people will be more educated and will only use them when they are really in need of it(I mean for medical use, the main reason why its been legalised right now).

Thank you so much for giving time to this post and I genuinely need you guy's thoughts about its legalization in the comments.

PS: It took me around 2-3 hours to write it and I now have so so much respect to all the Wiki-Volunteers out there. Thank You guys for the content much love.❤❤

Feel free to criticize me in the comments as its my first time writing anything like this.

13ta1xf,Suggestions to get out of a abusive marriage,"Hey so I’m going to try and make this as short as I can. 
My aunt is married to an alcoholic, they’ve been married for 30 years or something now and he’s been abusive (physically and mentally) the whole time. 

I just found out that the other day he beat her so hard because she went out on a day trip with her sisters and posted picture on her Facebook- she was bleeding all over her face and her body was swollen. Ofcourse my mother (her sister) called the police and the police arrested him but his sons (who live in Australia, as fucked up as it sounds) bailed his father out after one day!! The two sons are obviously on their fathers side. Just to note that the sons and their mum’s relationship has always been really bad…but it doesn’t justify that they took their fathers side in this. 

My mum and me and my family feel helpless. My aunt has no education and no job so she’s stuck to live with that abusive dog, ofcourse we have helped her financially as much as we can but there’s also only so much we can do. 

Does anybody has a similar stories in their family, if so what did you do to help the victim?

p8e6jw,Just a fucking weird experience,"So at around 12:15 AM, i finished up my work and started going to sleep. Then, while my eyes were open. Like literally open. I saw a office. Like in my mind. The people inside the office were talking to each other. I don't remember what but they were.

And then, it all zoomed out or zoomed in. SWOOSH. I'm pretty sure my eyes were closed at this point. I could see this old man walking on this slightly dried up river. Like it had little bit of water and lots of bit stones. He was walking along with bunch of other people.

Someone asked the old man where he was going. I don't remember if it was me. The old man said something along the lines that he was going to a place he had left behind and had been away for all this time. I vaguely remember him telling a long story about it. Can't remember.

The, I wake up in some resort with a late and woods all around. I go around making a mess everywhere. It turns out this bunch of rich people at the resort think I am rich and lemme party with them. I'm blank of this party phase but they show me some clips and such. I was crazy intozicated on alcohol. I don't remember any other drugs or anything. When I wake up, this partying had happened.

I go out, there's a lot of snakes there some 100 meters away from the cottage i woke up in. The snakes are gathered around a restaurant. I go to the restaurant where I meet the rich guys. We kayak on the lake. I jump into the river and swim. Earlier , I was scared of snakes and missed snake bites by a tiny bit, so i then proceed to eat a few snakes that the owner caught from outside. They are beautifully cooked and displayed on the plate. The rich guys act like they know me, I don't. They tell me a few things about me.

And then I start switching between dreams. In this new dream, It's raining. I am on the terrace of my house and I have this person that has wings with me. No hands just wings. I play in the rain for a bit. My parents were away for dinner at a relatives. I put on this weird cloth thingy and try to make wings. I flap my wings and fly. I flew a lot but I couldn't fly above a certain point. The winged man said I couldn;t do it coz I had to practice or get real wings. My mom dad come back and back to the resort dream we go.

At this point I'm aware I'm in my dreams but can't do shit. The rich guys showed me a video of me cursing the people for wasting a birthday cake by splashing the cake on the birthday girl's face and then throwing the cake out of the window. The rich guys in the resort then find out I'm not rich and kick me out. I see one of the rich guys is planning on marry my girlfriend. On the day of the marriage, I'm there to stop it.

I've only convinced the girl when the rich guy turns out to be some mafia boss. I beat his henchmen. I am fighting with the boss over the gun he picked up from one of his henchmen. We're on the ground tumbling around for the gun.

It got crazier. I wake up to find myself on the bed watching a movie on the TV where the same scene is happening. I think it was that new marvel movie, shang-chi. Now, I'm watching the movie. and when I close my eyes, I'm going back into the dream. I got all scared when i heard my mom's voice.

She called my name and asked if I was asleep. I just dumbly replied that i was asleep. She then asked if I was watching movies. She said"" It's 6 AM in the morning. Why are you still awake?""

I don't know what straw broke. I started screaming and crying. My mom then came inside the room and sort of hugged me. Then I just woke up in real life. I couldn't even distinguish whether this was a dream or reality for like a solid five minutes. I quickly typed this so that I don't forget the details.

I'm pretty normal rn but that was scary af. I woke up from that at around 2:40 AM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/p8e6jw/just_a_fucking_weird_experience/,8/20/2021 21:16,22,0,25,English,1,0,1,1,1,0
uy711h,Ganja kheti.. should it be legalized??,"Context: I got chance to travel to one of my friends village. There I stayed for one day and There I learned that his family has been doing ganja kheti for generations and still now too despite it is illegal.  Now seeing ganja kheti yeti open rupma I was kind of surprised. So I talked to him and to his grandfather about it.. 

So my first question was how profitable it to do it than traditional crops. The answer was like like dherai nai difference xa and profitable xa. Despite it is illegal they have been earning good revenue from it and grandfather gunaso was like sarkar le atti garxan mero purkhauli pesa nai yehi ho ani yetro satabdi samma kehi naramro vayena ani ahile aayeraw k na k jasto. Siva ji le ni khayekai hun.. Siva ko bhakta le ni pahila dekhi nai khairakhekai hun. K naramro vayeko xa type.. 

Later there I learnt dherai kura about ganja like uniharu ko family le sarpa ko poison ko treatment ma ni ganja use garne raixan ani 1st time I learned about ganja ko oil and oil lai use garxan for massage pain vayeko thauma.. Ani deit ma ni ganja ko use garne raixan... His grandfather told me that he has been using ganja in many Ayurvedic medicines which he makes.. 

So before this I used think ganja as source of recreation only. Tara yesko health benefits yeti dherai xa I didn't know. I also search today ani found there is an speculation that it can be used to treat cancer. Also learned ganja can help treating insomnia. As someone who has been insomniac I know katti mahango hunxa medicine and katti side effects hunxa tesko. So ganja might be alternative and cheap option there. 

Now, yetro sab sahi kura garda we cannot forget it have bad effects too. Like Hallucinations, over doge le ramro ni garxa. Like smoking le liver lai bigarxa..disrupt our blood vessels too.Tara at the same time alcohol and tobacco ma no any restriction xa.. Aru ni naramro kura hola which I am not denying. Tara at least yesto good side lai ni consider garna milxa ni. 

My opinion : I personally think ganja should be legalized medicinal use ko lagi matra and more research should be done on this to retrieve the ancient knowledge about it. Also government le fund garnu paryo the research. 
to be honest, I have smoked ganja with sathi vai but I think recreational use ko lagi ahile open garnu hunna. This might sound like a hypocritical statement. Tara I genuinely believe recreational uses ko lagi open garnu aghi more research should be done on its recreational uses effects. Also I fear teenagers rw children harule miss use garna sakxan that's why. Tara medicinal uses ko lagi I fully support it. 

Now some might disagree with me say ganja should be completely banned. Some might be like me supporting medicinal uses only and some might say recreational rw medicinal Dubai ko lai it should be legalized. So what are your opinions and why?

It is crucial to recognize warning signs when **strangers** broach subjects **such as alcohol, relationships, or sex, or taking them abroad, giving gifts,** particularly when interacting **with minors or vulnerable individuals**. While in Nepal, we have long embraced foreigners and treated them as esteemed guests. However, it is high time we adopt a more cautious approach, particularly when it comes to the safety of our young children and young adults. Just like we take precautions with our fellow Nepalese. I kindly urge individuals residing in affected areas to display signs or distribute pamphlets to raise awareness. If you see any of these actions taking place in front of you or see them online on youtube, I would encourage you to record their conversation and report it to the local police ASAP.  If you wish to contribute, I recommend directing donations to Maiti Nepal, an organization that has played a significant role in assisting the victims in this case.

&#x200B;

As an inquisitive individual, I found myself browsing YouTube, where I stumbled upon a video featuring Ice Posiedon in Nepal. Intrigued, I delved into the live stream, which subsequently led me to Kick. I must admit that I was unfamiliar with any of these streamers, except for Ice Poseidon. At that time, two specific streamers, Sam Pepers, and River Stone McKeever, were broadcasting their experiences in Kathmandu. Due to poor internet connectivity, I found myself switching between their streams. As the morning progressed and local stores opened for the day, Sam was occupied with fixing his equipment in New Road, while River McKeever ventured towards Basantapur. The video footage captures River engaging in disturbing behavior, referring to young girls as ""jawns"" and ""jawntent"" for content involving such girls, expressing his affection to random young girls on the street, and even proposing marriage. These interactions occurred within a one to two-hour timeframe. It is important to note that I was unable to watch the majority of the stream that day, so not all interactions are included in the aforementioned video.

&#x200B;

Throughout the stream, while primarily following Sam's stream whenever possible, I noticed numerous chat messages alerting him to River's alleged harassment of underage girls. Unfortunately, I did not personally witness these incidents, except for the ones I had recorded in the beginning. I was either occupied or engrossed in Sam's stream. As night fell, they proceeded to solicit prostitutes, an act that is, incidentally, illegal in Nepal.

&#x200B;

On the following day of the stream, a confrontation took place between Sam and River McKeever regarding allegations of harassing underage girls. I did not witness this live stream but watched the video on youtube after the 3 streamers were arrested. Subsequently, when Avrom Merlin, also known as Suspendas, arrived in Kathmandu, their behavior underwent a noticeable shift. River and Avrom were observed becoming more comfortable in their harassment of young girls, engaging in inappropriate rapping on the street, and displaying troubling conduct. Moreover, they approached several young girls, discussing the possibility of purchasing iPhones for them.

&#x200B;

It is imperative to acknowledge the abrupt change in Avrom's demeanor within a mere 10-12 hours of his arrival as if he suddenly became cognizant of the consequences of their actions in Nepal. It is pertinent to note that another guy named Harrison aka coolslick who accompanied them that night, asserted that Nepal would turn a blind eye to the conduct of tourists due to their economic contributions. However, such a statement is unfounded and detached from reality.

&#x200B;

Subsequently, the following day as we all witnessed a series of distressing incidents as they targeted additional girls during their visit to Swayambhunath Temple and its surroundings. The streamer named Harrison aka STD Andy/Coolslick joined them that day. He is no stranger in regard to talking about minors. Of particular concern is the disconcerting interaction documented during their third encounter on the temple grounds. The victims, two sisters, explicitly stated that one of them was underage by emphatically stating, ""NOT MATURE TO DATE."" Despite this explicit knowledge, the harassers persisted, raising the topic of alcohol. They did this with a pattern for multiple girls they talked to. In the video, the older sister clarifies the legal drinking age, while McKeever nonchalantly assumes that they are of legal age. Even in the face of uncertainty, he dismissively remarks, ""I don't know what class 10 (Grade 10) is, so I'll go along with it."" This flagrant disregard for their own recognition of the victim's immaturity and grade level underscores a manipulative inclination that permeates their live streams. Secondly, talking about incest to minors is a whole new topic.  


Below is a deleted Twitter post from Harrison aka Coolslick, STD Andy . He was also known to be racist in his Twitter post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/v9htce/comment/ibwjqqw/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/v9htce/comment/ibwjqqw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's truly disconcerting to imagine all this disgusting footage within just two days of their visit.

&#x200B;

These instances shed light on the urgent necessity to address and rectify the alarming behavior displayed by live streamers, YouTubers, or by any individual. Ensuring the safety and protection of Nepalese, especially minors, from potential harm or exploitation is of utmost importance. By raising awareness about these incidents, we aspire to cultivate a culture that prioritizes the well-being of all individuals and advocates for responsible online conduct.

Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight another disconcerting incident documented on YouTube. In this specific video, an older individual inquired about the plans of these underage girls (looks 10-12 years old) for an upcoming Saturday. When the three girls mentioned going to a café, the man persistently broached the subject of alcohol and bars, raising significant concerns of a RED FLAG. When confronted, he attempted to deflect blame by alleging that the girls had suggested going to the bar with him, contradicting the video evidence. Evens saying ""when people have bad intentions, they don't film it). Since then, no further videos have been uploaded by this individual.

**Recent cases**

[Another recent case](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/03/11/indians-top-list-of-foreigners-arrested-in-nepal-followed-by-chinese) where three girls aged 13, 14 and 17 were held hostage and sexually abused by a Chinese National in Kathmandu. Four other minors were kept hostage in Thamel.

 

In today's interconnected world, education is often seen as a shield against vulnerability. However, [recent incidents](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/04/three-nepali-women-escape-their-coercive-chinese-employers-in-laos-they-still-feel-unsafe-back-home) serve as a stark reminder that being educated does not make one immune to victimization. Strangers taking you abroad is not a good choice. 

Let this serve as a call to action for authorities, policymakers, and society as a whole. We must strengthen safeguards, enhance awareness campaigns, and establish robust support systems to combat exploitation in all its forms.

ymro6n,Thamel and Basantapur feel like areas where incidents similar to the recent Itaewon Halloween Disaster may happen,"I have attended a few gatherings over the years with friends during New Year's Eve and other occasions around Thamel and Basantapur, and regularly witnessed incidents of fights and angry exchanges fuelled by alcohol, drugs and aggression. Such incidents are often dealt with a heavy-handed approach from cops and bouncers, and they often feel like a potential trigger for a much worse disaster. Yet, there is hardly any open place to escape during incidents of stampede and preparation for a potential disaster seems next to nil. That's why lately I tend to avoid going to these places during busy festive occasions and instead head to less crowded areas around the outskirts. Recently, 150 people were killed in a stampede at the Itaewon district of Seoul, a popular tourist-spot that's similar to Thamel and Jhonchhen/Basantapur.

1. The guy is NOT being charged for Murder but for Homicide by Accident
2. No mentions about drink driving..probably because it was too late when they did the DUI test or they simply erased the evidence.
3. The husband of the decease apparently mentioned in the court that his wife was on her phone when the accident occurred...So they have a new angle of ""Negligence from the victim's part"" now.
4. Our judicial system usually gives bail to Homicide by Accident cases.

eulz4f,Domestic Violence,"  

Just a few weeks ago when my father came home very drunk he badly beat up my mother when she refused to listen to his drunken discussions. I was sleeping in my room when I suddenly heard shouting and banging noises from upstairs so I headed upstairs to see that my father had punched my mother on her face and she was bleeding by the time I went upstairs blood was dripping down her face and badly swollen on the left side of her face. My mother was wiping her face and my sister was crying besides her as for my father as soon as I saw that scene I asked why did you do this? What did you do to my mother? He said that she didn’t agree to listen to me and she was trying to push me away when what she really was doing was she was trying to defend herself from my father.

I froze when I saw my mother and my sister crying and yelling to call someone I didn’t know who should I call so the first thing I did was dial 100 and call the police to come quickly. When the police arrived my father said to the police that it was just a small argument nothing has happened blah blah blah basically telling that it wasn't his mistake and he did it because my mother was not listening to him and was doing things he didn’t agree. I found out that my father was telling her to take early retirement and stay at home to do housework. After many discussions with the police, they finally took him to the police station they put him in jail overnight and my relatives and I took my mother to the hospital she got treated and next morning my father said that he didn’t even remember what he did the night before and didn’t even admit his mistake. At the police station, they made an agreement paper saying that if my father again repeats this behavior again then he will be charged legally. 

My main concern is if my father doesn’t even regret his wrongdoings acts as if it was not his mistake to do what he has done. How can we live together as a family?

krrx3l,Hi! Here is some tips on dating! For young men.,"I have dated a lot of people. My girlfriend went to another school that you never heard of. She's a 10. So, I am a stud. Here are some tips.
1. If you are a male, never and I mean never be funny. Smiling attracts jealousy. So be as sour as possible. Better yet, always look angry. This will remind the female of their angry alcoholic father.
2. Do not text first. Those who text first are losers.
3. Most importantly, have good looks. What if you don't have good looks? Go see point 1. Look like a sour lemon.
4. Be born in a rich family. What if you are poor, go see point 3.
5. Do not make promises or go to extremes such as cutting your wrists. They don't care. It will hurt you. Instead join a gym. That will show her.

Yes. This is how I have acquired a girlfriend who is a 10. She is the best.

TL;DR
This is a shitpost and a satire. Do not follow any of the advice above and be yourself. You will find your own groove. If you are single, it must be for a reason. If you think someone doesnt like you for who you are, they probably misunderstand you. Don't let their opinion be your identity. Be your own person and most importantly be safe for you and your partner. Cheers.

104bslg,A script I wrote after a long time,"#  After summer comes Autumn.

“Man, I feel so low. Me and this guy started at the same level but now he has accomplished so much more both individually and professionally. I gave all my time and spent all my money on this girl. She made me feel something I hadn’t felt before but now she broke up with me. I feel like shit and I am coping by wasting my time smoking weed and drinking alcohol”.

My relationships haven’t lasted for more than 6 months. I blamed the girls for it. But if it happens to you more than two times then it's prolly you, not them.  Ever since I was a kid I always fantasised about girls. I always pushed myself. I forced myself to get a positive change like working out or getting better grades or starting a new hobby because I wanted to impress a girl. In my mind I said to myself “If I could achieve this goal of mine I will ask her out”. Recently I got a bit drunk with my friends. I don’t remember shit. But they told me I talked about a girl for 3 hours. They told me I praised her so much that they cringed. I was shocked hearing about this debacle because for the longest time I had suppressed my inner thoughts/feelings. I made myself believe I dont like her anymore. The reason is simple: I don't see myself in a relationship with her. She was just a goal that I chased. Somewhat deep inside I knew that I won't ever be in a relationship with her but I told myself if I get 90 in Maths I’ll go ask her out but then I got 83. Then again I told myself if I work out for 3 months straight I’ll ask her out. But I ended up working out for a month and a half. Although I didn’t reach my final goals I was able to implement some positive changes. This girl helped me get so many positive changes and was such a big part of my life and the funny thing is that she doesn’t even know it. To get some kind of closure I did kindda asked her to go get a coffee or watch a movie with me. But she said she is a bit busy. She didn’t reject me nor did I press her or put much effort into asking her to go out with me. So, I kinda have half closure as I know she has a boyfriend and my chances of getting with her is zero atm. This is why I have half closure as I still have some hopes of going out with her one day.  But the thing is I don’t think it matters anymore. I feel like if I was in a relationship with her I would not have been able to implement all these positive changes to my life. My subconscious self somewhat knew that she was a fantasy and I would never be in a relationship with her but it used her as a pushing force to implement healthy choices in my life. 

In 2018 I started dating this girl that I met online. It was all long distance, I never met her irl. We were going good. Then I ghosted her for months. You know why I did that? I did it because of two reasons. One: studies, Two: my crush. I was in a relationship and I liked another girl. What a dumbass I was. What a complete maroon. What a doofus. My friends tell me that she texted them about my whereabouts, where tf I was. I was a stupid person for ghosting her but I think she doesn’t even remember me so yeah there’s that. After we broke off I didn’t feel much of anything for a few weeks. But after the first few weeks I felt so shit. I had never felt this shitty my whole life.This was my first heartbreak. When one is heartbroken he either goes full incel  or starts exploring his creative sides. Me I did em both. I started sketching her like a mad artist and I even posted her sketch on my insta feed. She asked me why I posted her sketch. I felt embarrassed and deleted it. I felt so lonely and sad. In this period I might have truly been depressed. I wasn’t interested in studying, playing football. I lost a few kilos and started binge watching movies, animes and series that had a happy relationship component in it; just to feel better. To top that off I cut ties with most of my friends because I was embarrassed and I felt like they made fun of my situation. They thought of it as a joke. So, I started writing. Writing my heart off. Just have a look at my earlier writings. Shit is embarrassing but hey its better than drinking or starting some other harmful addiction. After a while I got fed up with all the sketching and writings so I started becoming more political and became an incel and started hating on women and even turned into a white supremacist and a full fledged Nazi at a point. 

Although I am not as successful as Kanye. I feel like the situation I went through resembles the situation he is going through atm. I disagree with almost everything he stands for but I can emphasize  with the shit he’s going through and yeah his music does slap.

According to a famous philosopher Carl Jung  a break up could potentially bring out an artistic side in someone as the experience of a break up can be a very emotional and transformative one, and these intense emotions can often be a source of inspiration for artistic expression. When people are going through difficult experiences, they may turn to art as a way to process and make sense of their emotions. According to another Philosopher Fredrick, Nietsczhe art has the power to transform and elevate human consciousness, and can serve as a means of overcoming suffering and finding meaning in life. I am kind of dumb and not good with all these philosophical shits but from what I have interpreted from Jung’s and Nietzsche's work is that after a break up you have all these pent up heavy emotions and there’s a hole that gets left by the person that you once loved and some people like my friend that I quoted at the beginning of the video get overwhelmed by the emotions and get consumed by these feelings of worthlessness and to numb it they like to drink and wallow in their sadness and pity themselves. And there are other people like myself that get depressed but instead of drinking they use these emotions to express themselves artistically. In Fact the reason why I started sketching 5 years ago was because of my breakup with my ex and the reason why I stopped 2 years ago was because I no longer feel these strong emotions since my last break up.

Another thing that I have learned from this relationship is that a relationship succeeds when a person is complete in themselves. When they are not looking for someone to complete them but someone they prefer the company of. The girl that I had a crush on had everything that I wanted in a girl. She was smart, kind, understanding, social, watched football and overall she was just a genuine person. At Least that’s the impression I got from her. I watched this film called 500 days of summer and there is this quote from the protagonist’s sister that stuck with me “Just because someone likes the same crap as you do, that doesn’t make her your soulmate”. This was true in my case as well. I thought the girl that I had a crush on was my soulmate and as a result I shunned the girl that I was in a relationship with. It’s amazing that the girl that I was in a relationship with accepted me for all the flaws that I had, which at that time were many. I loved talking to her, and loved her company but I wasn’t complete in myself so i fucked up that relationship. But hey, after every summer comes autumn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/104bslg/a_script_i_wrote_after_a_long_time/,1/5/2023 22:07,4,0,2,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
pk3i6z,thoughts on the cannabis ban in nepal ?,"hey, im sorry if this is a stupid question, but i was studying religious history in nepal, and as i was researching, i found myself quite interested in the significance of cannabis in hinduism.

 i fell down a rabbit hole and learned about the cannabis ban in nepal, the part hippies played in it and everything else. i have a basic understanding of why the ban was put in place, however i do not understand why it was never lifted, seeing how it has been years. 

the ban caused so many problems in communities that depended on the cultivation of cannabis as their only source of income. marijuana is legal in a lot of places and if managed properly, it would be great if it was the same here. it would boost the economy, be beneficial for a lot of people medically, and would prevent people from obtaining it illegally right ?

is there a significant reason why the ban cannot be lifted ? do the cons out-weigh the pros ?

fto2rf,Review : Golden Oak,"Feeling bored at home I decided to find the nearest booze shop and buy me some booze. 

I was assuming lockdown to be like Nepal banda but this lockdown closed all local bhattis and booze shop. I tried buying some from Bhatbhateni as I came to know they were delivering daily essentials. Turns out alcohol and beer aren't considered daily essentials. Luckily I found one small shop near my home. They had beers and alcohol. I didn’t have enough cash as I was not able to visit the ATM and had around Rs300. 

Plus, I felt awkward to carry beer in this time of unprecedented mahamari. I purchased Golden Oak as it was cheap and easy to conceal and transport back home.

I used to drink local raksi and chyang and rarely drank Golden Oak. During initial days it was not that bad. So I was assuming to have some quality booze time with my purchase.

Drinking this thing neat made me realize this is shit booze. The taste was extremely bitter, like chewing karela. This was the time I missed “jigri”, I regretted not buying cola to mix. The bottle said 38% alcohol but even after 180ml, it had little to no effect on me.

My quest for cheap thrill ended bitterly.

Today I purchased Black Oak and this is somewhat better than its counterpart.

I recently came across a Reddit post discussing people's indiscriminate behavior towards tourists. Many mentioned Nepalis being rude and providing poor services to Indians. While I recognize the political tensions between India and Nepal, I believe it's our politicians and their cowardly behaviors that contribute to the blame on India, rather than the country itself.

I study abroad like a lot of Nepalis, and I was texting my friend back home while sitting next to a Chinese friend, who happened to see and ask why we were conversing in English/Latin rather than our own Nepali/Devanagari. I didn't have a real answer for him, other than that we were made to speak in English at all times in school, and that we were punished if we spoke our native language. Its a shame that kids are taught this, it is a shame on our system and society that thinks this is a good thing. No other place outside of Nepal/North India has such a culture in private schools which expressly forbid us from speaking our own language. Go to any other country's subreddit and you'll see most of the posts and people conversing there will be in their own language, the minority of English language posts will come from tourists/immigrants.

14gndod,Why do most of you guys hate your own country's independence so bad ?,"Let me clear it first: This post is not intended to promote any form of hatred towards any communities. However, if it has inadvertently caused any distress or offense, I sincerely apologize for that. And ""I am not a nationalist"".

Why do a significant number of individuals from Nepal in this subreddit vehemently defend every misstep taken by the Indian government against Nepal, while simultaneously attacking every single decision made by Nepal that doesn't favor India? Is this allegiance driven by the fact that both India and Nepal are Hindu-majority states with shared cultural ties, or is it primarily influenced by our substantial economic and trade dependency on India? Or you guys get paid for? 

अब  त India लाई criticise गर्न पनि नहुने भइसक्यो, India पनि Hindu majority state हो  र नेपाल भारतसँग धेरै परानिर्भर छ भन्दैमा भारत विरुद्ध केही बोल्नु नहुने रे । भारत विरुद्ध कुनै व्यक्तिगत धारणा पनि राख्न पाइदैन त। Like बालेनले Hindi movie ban गर्दा सामान्य Indian हरूलाई त्यती पिर पर्या छैन होला   even many of them are supporting this ban. तर केही नेपालीलाई दरो पिर परीरहेको छ They possess a profound love for India that often surpasses that of the average Indian, exhibiting a stronger sense of Indian than the average Indian citizen. They embody the true spirit of being an Indian soldier, surpassing even those Nepalese who serve in the Indian army.

190xmsx,I have a question for people of this country who hate Nepal to its gut that they wish / will allow India to annex Nepal.,"My last post was "" **Is your disdain so deep you'd prefer foreign rule? ""**   


To my surprise, the hate towards the country was mind blowing, I thought there will be fair share of comments that will support their own country to not be annexed by India regardless of how bad the current situation is but the hate was there, more than the love, and I believe its because its reddit.  


I am confident that the number of people who harbor intense dislike will be significantly less than those who are compassionate, even outside of Reddit. However, I perceive a recurring trend here, which I believe is not beneficial. I want to express my strong disapproval of the current system in Nepal, the Nepali government, and the corrupt individuals in Nepal. I detest the negative aspects of my country, perhaps even more so than others. The only influence I possess as an individual to effect change is through my vote, by electing responsible individuals, and by raising awareness about the potential for positive change. After taking these steps, all I can do is “hope” that others will do the same. I believe that “corruption” is the root cause of all the problems in our country. We, as Nepali people, are highly corrupt. I have friends who used to proclaim that corruption was the biggest issue during our school days, but now, when they are in positions of power and working government jobs, they themselves are engaging in corruption. I know people who didn’t go to Australia on merit, but falsified their documents and found a workaround to get there. These are just some examples, I know many of you are corrupt to, knowingly or unknowingly. I also know, when people go to higher places of power, power corrupts. So, until a significant number of people genuinely stop being corrupt and refrain from promoting corruption when they are in power, I don’t foresee any changes happening in our country. Regardless of the current dire situation, I would never dream of my beautiful country being annexed by another. This is not some right-wing ultra-nationalist sentiment, as some comments in that post suggested.  


I have a question to the extreme haters of our country that they are more than happy for our country to be annexed by India, and the question is :  


\- Moving to India is as simple as moving to another city in our country, the culture matches, language is understandable, food is similar, no visa required, all you will need is a little amount to move there in order to start your new life there and struggle like the other people of India. So If you are in Nepal, Why aren't you moving to India but want India to annex Nepal ?  


\- And similar question to the people who hate Nepal to its core and are currently abroad in a different country than India, Why are you in that country but want India to annex Nepal ? Why aren't you in India ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/190xmsx/i_have_a_question_for_people_of_this_country_who/,1/7/2024 17:42,0,0,26,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

You know those stupid people who think they know everything and try to force their opinion down your spine? Yeah I used to hate them so much. But recently while examining my own communication patterns as well as from other people's opinions, I seem to be doing just that. Making arguments that fit my logic and then preaching them without the other party needing to agree. I only notice after the fact that I should have stopped at an earlier point and then the regret hits me hard.

I'm tired of myself ruining conversations and entire relationships by being too self absorbed and I've tried ... to just not put myself so high up in my eyes and just maybe listen, but the subconscious takes over at some point and it's usually too late when I finally regain consciousness about what I've been doing all along.

This has frustrated me and everyone I seem to talk to for a prolonged time. My dreams of becoming that charismatic social civilized well mannered and ethic-centred individual are shattering right in front of my eyes and I don't know why I'm not being able to open my folded hands to just avoid the destruction.

They say religion takes us places , only if that place is delusion. Religion is so stupid. How come people  haven’t figured out that it’s just a silly made up story someone came up with in ancient time to answer how the world came to exist . And people really think religion brings them peace and I can’t stand people explaining about their stupid spiritual journey ! Oh really dude did RELIGION really made you a better person ? How exactly does it make you a better person . By asking you to believe that the god you believe in is actually the right god and rest of them are not. Religion makes you delusional it and it ends your capacity to be rational . It’s just a thing to control huge number of masses and to direct them to act in the exact way the people in power want them to act. I can’t fathom the fact that these religious cunts are still in business even after all these terrorism shit , small kids being molested in churches , women being burnt alive and what not !

People may still judge me here and be like “Etro thulo vayera no cartoon herdao raicha bla..bla…bla” but it’s waayyyy better then vaping and watching innapropriate adult video that people these days do. 

If you’re from my generation, then you most likely Remember ninja Hattori. So I’ve decided to do some character analysis. This is my honest opinion.

Amara:- Honestly, as a kid I used to HATE this guy as a kid. But when I re-watch the series , he still ain’t my favourite but He’s the character that I sympathise for. Amara is a perfect example of how villains are made and not born. At the age of 10/11 bro lives all by himself with a cat and takes all the household responsibilities. Though he’s an antagonist he’s still got his soft side.

Kenechi:- I now have a mixed feeling about this character. He practically USED Hattori for his own gain and often envious of him. And bro is a total SIMP over Yumiko who’s got no self respect. If I was his place I’d learn discipline and self improvement from Hattori 

Yumiko:- I used to envy her character and I always wanted to be like her as a kid. But now I despise her more than Amara. She’s an  entitled little pain in the back.  She USES Amara, Kenichi for her own gain. Sometimes she laughs at Kenechi at his worst when Amara humiliates him. This shows the heartlessness in her character. 

Hattori:- WAYYY TOO mature for his age. Bro does seem to have a crush on sonam but he prioritises his training and responsibilities. 

Shinzo:- Adorable little fella

Sisimanu :- My dream pet

Sonam. She was the most  underrated character I must say. Although she’s a remarkable ninja. She’s wayyyyy better than Yumiko. She has her both feminine side and strong, intelligent female lead side. She’s far better then Yumiko. She’s very loyal towards Hattori. She goes out of her way to help people . Though on the outside she’s shown as angry, annoying and bitchy. She’s got a heart of pure gold. I’m disappointed how she isn’t one of the main characters.

pv93j4,Why do yall Nepali dudes be hating on kpop so much?,"I’m a Nepali dude from the UK. Rai to be exact. I used to not be a fan of kpop. But recently I can’t lie, I’ve been enjoying KPOP but mostly Krnb with artists like Zico, dean and crush. Main reason why I’ve changed my mind about kpop was because Kpop has given Asian men a much better view from the world. I mean Nepali dudes not living in an Asian country would know how ‘undesirable’ Asian men are seen as. I mean just look at the western stereotypes of Asian men. (Nerdy, short, small dick, ugly and weak) all of these stereotypes are not true. Mainly started by anti-japanese propaganda during WW2. Some Hollywood examples include 16 candles, breakfast at tifanny’s or fu Manchu. And from a very honest standpoint Indian men have it even worse out here in the western world.
I mean surveys show that Asian men are considered the least desirable by women.

So kpop is really changing the view of how Asian men are seen as. Finally Asian men are seen as attractive to the worlds eyes. I see a lot of posts of nepali dudes complaining about how nepali girls love kpop. Just Let them love it! It’s not like all the nepali women in the world are going to leave you for some Korean oppar in Korea. So chillax and don’t get agitated bros.

Edit: I was planning to go visit him but just got my periods. It's kinda religious thing so I thought I should not visit him rn so I told his friend what happened and his friend told me that I should definitely try texting him or something. Mind you, we were best friend for years. But we had a really rough past and I had blocked him in all social media platform even tiktok and snapchat. I had no ways to connect to him except calling him and his friend also insisted that I should call him. usko sathile jhan uslai bhetera aaye pachi ta call gara ki gara bhanna thalyo. I guessed something was not right and I asked his number from his friend and dial garna khojeko call uthayo bhane k bhanni bhanera call uthaunu bhanda agadi nai kaat diye. ani maile hamro mutual friend lai call garna lagaye ani they talked.

I told him mero paila ko phone harayo ani timro number pani harayo and in my new phone I didn't have your number so I asked ... and he gave me. I spoke like some kid forced to speak infront of the assembly. and he said ehh expecting me to continue the conversation. At this point I was blank. Maile ratta mareko saab question sakki sakeko thiyo and I know for sure he wanted to share what was going on with him to me but I couldn't say anything. I just froze for whole ass 25 seconds. BLOODY 25 SECONDS IN A CALL. Kasto awkward. Even he was embarrassed for me. And after those long 25 seconds I just told him busy chau jasto cha and he said something but I was too embarrassed to even understand what he was telling ani I said take care and he cut the call before I could say bye.

I swear to god usle ahh busy chu bhaneko bhaye ta take care bye bhanna milthyo but what if he had told testo busy ta chaina and he was trying to share something but I just told take care.

qn4x1u,Man I hate my Dad's side of the family.,"Most of them are toxic af (not all, but many are) and I would have cut them off from my life but Dad can't. After all they are his family. Ofc my Mom's side have their faults as well but my Dad's side make them look like saints. My dad's side are like ""Give them an inch and they will take a mile"". Hell, they will and have taken advantages of my Dad (for him, family is family no matter the problems they cause), and that makes me mad af. Thankfully my Dad has learned from his mistakes and now sees them as the snakes that they are. 

They have done many shameless things, even straightup illegal things but they keeping coming for more. They are so unchanging in their ways that I would rather not have any contact with them my whole life.

I feel like most of the people's Dad's side are toxic af. At least  that's what I have seen and from what people have told me about.

q77xd7,Anybody else hate the general vibe of Dashain?,"Unpopular opinion or not but, I have a distaste for Dashain. I can’t really pinpoint what it really is. I think it’s a lot of things.

- the killings. I don’t know if I’d feel differently if I ate 🐐 but the sight is plain awful. 

No disrespect to the historical significance of this festival though. I just do not like Dashain for these audio and visual reasons I guess. At this moment nothing comes to mind but I’m sure I can find a few if I’ll contemplate enough.

I was like, Wait! But why? That's their country, Not ours. Even if we become foreign citizen, then why do we have to become in the first place? When foreigners hard work in their own country, then we Nepalese sure have to work hard double of that.

Why complain and hate towards the foreign country? And you have a very easy simple choice. You either have to struggle or return back to your country and shut up about your poor story of living abroad and just work hard in your country.

Always blaming foreign country, foreigners, Aafnai desh raamro, Aafnai desh ko khaana mithoh, Bidesh maa saarai dukha, malai ta manai pardaina Yo Japan, Japanese haroo, UK, British haroo, etc.

jggdda,What I hate about Nepal.,"There are many people in Nepal who think posting something about country makes them patriotic and nationalist but I think those are most dangerous people to country who are blind to see the weakness of country that is yet to be improved upon. To understand reason behind my such mindset.  First of you have to be free from Jingoism and Xenophobia. Because politician are the one put those kinds of seeds into you.

* 📷 [Jingoism,  racism, fear, religious fundamentalism: these are the ways of appealing  to people if you're trying to organize a mass base of support for  policies that are really intended to crush them.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/665585?ref=jingoism)[Noam Chomsky](https://www.azquotes.com/author/2834-Noam_Chomsky)
* [Growing up in New York City, I was always encouraged to question authority, and I think I confused patriotism with jingoism.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/71573?ref=jingoism)

[Claire Danes](https://www.azquotes.com/author/3618-Claire_Danes)

Patriotism to limited space is good but once it is over the boundary it becomes toxic.

Most of the Nepalese are taught this things from School and they often confuse Jingoism with patriotism. Like : Buddha was born in Nepal ( that was 2500 years ago, Even then there is nothing to tell that everytime.), Mt. Everest and other 8 of the tallest peaks are in Nepal ( That was natural you and I did nothing about that). Nepal is 2nd richest country in water resources (which it is not it 20 according to wikipedia and in some places it is listed 43rd position), Nepal is so diversified within such small territory (There are so many country that diversified as Nepal even some in Africa). And many more things.

I will list bad things first and good things then:

**Slowly dying free speech. Our voices are getting further and further away from authority. Now everywhere around Nepal people are getting more corrupted. They do corruption in millions of dollars.They even did corruption in Medical sector (during COVID-19) buying useless second hand PCR machines and other equipment just to get commission. Our Aviation sector is also in similar state. Our country couldn't even bring back it's land of disputed region.  Any foreign diplomat can meet our prime minister. (India's Chief of RAW). They can't even provide better hospital facility. Rapist are roaming freely even after 2 years long time. We are paying 240% tax in vehicle (Though it may help in reducing pollution) but they are also increasing tax in electric vehicle. People in the status are misusing their power for personal benefit. Last time, Gokul Baskota was caught red handed with Rs. 70 Crore fraud and no action is taken. Also, Yuba Raj Khatiwada  and his cabinet increased tax in books and reduced tax in chocolate Why? Do you know that? Because He was friend with Bishal Groups : Anuj Aggrawal. He literally gave priority to chocolate than books even though more tax can be collected in Chocolate. Politician are trying to incorporate MCC in Nepal which is totally destructive for nation's secularism. India has always tried to disrupt Our country's peace. For example when King Birendra purposed Nepal to be Peace zone more than 100 or so ( I don't remember the exact number) countries agreed but India didn't agree. (Due to which we are not peace zone).  Our country is literally surviving on the blood our Nepalese brother and sister who are working in foreign countries. Things that you are consuming in your daily basis are not the things that were produced in Nepal. Even Palpali Dhaka is brought from china in high quantity and is assembled in Nepal. We our export tea and coffee to India but later on buy the packaged form from India again. How do you explain that? We use everything from top to bottom made in other countries.**

**( I don't know how do you take pride in being Nepali)**

**If you want to know more on how India is trying to disrupt our peace and development you can read books like; Raktabeej, Raktakunda by Krishna Abhiral. There he have explained beautifully which I can't put in words. So, I strongly suggest you to read. If you want to know how our politician are making our country hollow on others demand (businessman and foreigners) then you can watch; Why so offended (Show is very factual) and other news like Sidha Kura Janta Sanga.**

&#x200B;

There are much more things that have made my such mindset. I don't want to talk about things in detail that happening in society. **Most Nepalese have crab mindset. They just want to succeed but don't want to labor hard. There are some who do labor hard but in wrong direction.**

Now I want to list some good things that are really worth talking:

**There are people like Sanduik Ruit who are like angels in the human form. People like Sandip Lamichanne, Ravi Lamichanne, Kulman Ghising, Dr. Kc and many more who are doing their job with full dedication and sincerity. There are many naturally beautiful places to visit.(But we don't have great infrastructure to go there. Due to which we have less tourism). There  are many people who are doing great things within community and helping each other grow. There are many people who look after each other during their hard times. There is unity within different religious groups, castes and admiration for others culture.**

To Conclude, There are very few good things in Nepal than there are bad things in Nepal. Due to which people find other countries worth living in. W*e are dependent on foreign for following things;*

Jobs/ Employment

Food and Clothes

Innovation & Technology

Education (World class)

Better health facility

Quality of life

Economically / Financially

and Many more. And how to take that with pride?

It not like I hate Nepal so I want to live abroad but I hate Nepali system that is deeply rooted in corruption and evil that it's hard for anyone willing to change it forever. Due to foreign dependent. (India and China's disrupt in development and peace). **I just don't want to be part of Jingoism and Xenophobia I beg to differ.**

And I think that this is the reason why so many Nepalese settle in Foreign when they get chance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/jggdda/what_i_hate_about_nepal/,10/23/2020 4:46,13,0,20,English,1,1,1,1,1,2

kh9q0y,"If you are someone who is angry today and also hates Gyanendra for being anti-democratic, remember that Gyanendra had to take command of the nation 15 years ago because of similar circus like today in much worse environment.","Given the ignorance of good portion of r/nepal users on matter that befell us just yesterday, I can clearly assume how much ignorant most people are of what happened 15 to 20 years ago. They have been fed with one sided propaganda against Gyanendra by these same jokers from these political parties.   


Sher Bahadur deuba dissolved the pariliament in 2002. Gyanendra didnt do anything at the time. We were at the height of civil war, and the political circus continued. Deuba failed to do anything at all. Gyanendra then dismissed Deuba for being incompetent and further destabilizing the country. He chose total of 3 PMs to conduct election, re-establish parliament, talk with the rebels and get into a peaceful agreement.   


They all proved incompetant, including deuba for the second time. Maoist insurgency was at its ultimate height. Police dying in dozens everday, innocents civilians killed needlessly.  We were at the dead end.   


Gyanendra gave every chance for the democratic way to clear the road but similar political circus befell us back then while people were dying on the streets. Everything else failed, so gyanendra finally took command of the country.  


Many people think that Gyanendra moved in Nepal army inside the country, he didn't. It was democratically elected govrnment at the time that moved Nepal army against the maoist insurgency.

I'm not trying to nitpick every details out there but making a post on facts that stick out like a sore thumb like I've done previously a couple of times, obviously looking for some explanation and different perspectives.

Absolutely no offence meant!

Mahadev, high asf and intoxicated, decided to hand Parvati Mata to Jalandhar. Vishnu Bhagwan came to her rescue and advised Parvati Mata to do some Barta, and he followed up with the process where he mentioned that there is a place called Nepal where she has to go and do some sort of stuff (Nepal vanne euta thau cha jaha tapaile etc...)

I was like, Nepal as an unified country believed to be formed around 17th century by Prithvi Narayan Shah. It was in existence long before but in the form of smaller countries (22se 24se Rajya). So for Vishnu Bhagwan to mention Nepal, it had to be in existence already, which means Gods were here around that time.

Disclaimer; I'm not an atheist,  neither some Christian missionary (the only missionary I know...well you know), hate radicalized Musl\*\*s as well. It's just....please read the first paragraph.



Edit- Majority of the commentators completely missed the mark. Post could be full of historical inaccuracies for all I care, that still wouldn't change the issues raised in this post. It wouldn't have made any difference whether Nepal was in existence before or around 17th century,  or how the term ""Nepal"" was coined.

I'm seeing a sudden rise of this religion out of nowhere. Even though i haven't lived long enough in Nepal but i can remember that it was never like this when i arrived here. I see this religion related videos and post in all over my social media and i even saw alot of stickers related to it in the back of many cars when i travelled around Eastern terai regions. I know that this religion is one of the oldest in the world but the craze and the devotion came out of no where. Yes i know about the clash between hindus and Muslims in India is really old and it shows the devotion of hindus towards their religion but this new craziness and devotion came out of nowhere and is creating a toxic environment. I'm seeing people who are like 12-13 writing sanatan 🚩.... And their respective gods names in their bio and shitting out towards other's religion and even giving threats to someone who question's their religion. Young people are being more influenced by religion more quicker than ever and somehow are learning the toxicity and hating any other religion that isn't as same as theirs.

1anadpy,Harka Sampang is dangerous to democracy,"Harka Sampang is growing more and more unhinged. I saw this video of him where he was talking (more like scolding) to an employee of some telecom company. He was basically acting like the kings of olden times where he was reprimanding a peasant for insulting a king.

The saddest part is people are actually cheering him on. This is a clear corruption of power and violation of freedom of speech. This looks very dictatorial. There was another incident where je jaile a guy who was just complaining on the road. 

One other point that I hate and people seem to have no problem with is, 

Shram Daan

I hate this glorification of manual labor with a passion. I am not saying it is bad to do manual labor but he makes anyone that cannot do manual labor as useless. Think about the disabled, old or just physically week, or even the people that are just too busy to come there. Our leaders are supposed to make everyone feel equal and find solutions that can work in long term and set-up a system that will last long. We have seen the failure of Bagmati Safai Abhiyan, bagmati is stil shit. Just because 100 regular people come together every week, it's not going to make this into a developed country. We need better policies and systems in place. Harka seems to just rant about others and fight with everyone, literally. I am so surprised how he even has 100 supporters at this point. His statements are very god like where he claims he is the only one that can change this country. And his followers are just following like he is a god.

We met yesterday for the first time. It was good she passed the vibe check. Today we planned to meet again and go Nagarkot. My dick pulse was at maximum doing 500 dhuk dhuk every minute because i was very excited.

She picked me up from Bhaktapur on her scooter. Within 2 seconds i knew she was a horrible-est driver. This woman has no concept of pothole or speed break or incoming traffic. She drove in one speed and my ass was hurting from nonstop bouncing on the seat.

The worst part is still not here. when we got near Nagarkot ko chui chui snake bato she started to drive on the wrong side. I told her to stay on left lane but she replied esari nai sajilo hunxa. We almost got hit by vehicles and got scolded by one bus driver and tractor driver. After that she came to left lane.

When scooter was climbing uphill in full throttle she started to fix her mirror. The scooter started going chui chui chui chui left right left right no balance. She did this two times within a minute. We almost fell down.

I very much doubt she obtained her license by passing trial. She fed money to the cows in transport office.

By the time we reached Nagarkot I had lost all my attraction and horny power towards her. We went to a cafe and didnot talk even a word. I told her I have to return and I returned on bus and teusi.

14xm7du,"Maist killed 17,000. Did they?","Maoist insurgency was the civil war. It was the war against the ruling power. I know the reasons for what maoist went to insurgency are still not fulfilled but I don't see any reason to say maoist killed 17,000 people or Prachanda killed 17,000 people because most of these people were killed by the ruling force. For the information, around 8,200 people (including Maoists and common people) were killed by the ruling force and around 4,500 people (including common people) were killed by Maoist. Clearly, the Nepal government killed more people than Maoist. I don't see people saying Nepal sarkar killed 17,000 people or raja le 17,000 mare. (Do your independent research for the fact). The reason why killings by government forces are still not known to the masses is because the right to information was next to nothing at that time.

It was a civil war and peace die in civil war. At the end let's not forget what we have gone through but lets not stuck on the history also - lets move forward, lets choose representives who could bring change. Jay Nepal

PS: None of my family members were killed due to maoist insurgency and I can't even fathom what the family members of the people killed during Maoist insurgency (have or are) going through. I just shared my concern and I am okey towards the hate comments I might get. Have a great time all

यस्तो थियो घटना  
  
२०६० फागुन ५ गते वीरेन्द्र शान्ति तालिम केन्द्र पाँचखालबाट खटिएको सेनाको टोली खरेलथोक–६ कि देवी सुनुवारको घरमा पुग्यो । देवीलाई घरमा नभेटेपछि सैनिक टोलीले खरेलथोकस्थित भगवती मावि कक्षा ९ मा अध्ययनरत मैना सुनुवारलाई पक्राउ गर्‍यो । त्यति बेला मैना १५ वर्षकी थिइन् ।  
  
सैनिक टोलीले छिमेकीहरूलाई मैनालाई लिन काभ्रेको लामिडाँडा आउनू भनी निर्देशन दिएका थिए । सैनिक टोलीले अनाहकमा १५ वर्षीया किशोरीलाई पक्राउ गर्नुको कारण भने प्रतिशोधसँग जोडिएको छ । मैनालाई नियन्त्रणमा लिनुभन्दा ५ दिनअघि फागुन १ गते सेनाको छुट्टाछुट्टै टोलीले रिना रसाइली, शुभद्रा चौलागाईं र टासी लामाको हत्या गरेको थियो ।  
  
सेनाले मुठभेडमा मारिएको दाबी गरे पनि मैनाकी आमा देवीले मुठभेड नभई नियन्त्रणमा लिएपछि आफ्नी भतिजी रिनाको हत्या भएको बताइन् । रिनालाई नियन्त्रणमा लिएपछि सैनिक अधिकारीहरूले गोठमा लगेर ‘अनैतिक व्यवहार गरेको’ सैनिक अभिलेखमै उल्लेख छ । त्यसको पाँच घण्टापछि उनको मृत्यु भएको घटनाकी साक्षी मैनाकी आमा देवी रहेको जनरल सैनिक अदालतकै विवरणमा छ ।  
  
घटना सार्वजनिक गर्न मैनाकी आमा देवीले अधिकारकर्मीहरू बोलाइन् । देवीकै कारण मानव अधिकार उल्लंघनको भेद खुल्ने भयो भन्ने त्रासका कारण सैनिक टोली उनको घरमा आएको स्थानीय बताउँछन् । माइती गएकी देवीलाई नभेटेपछि सैनिक टोली उनकी छोरी मैनालाई नियन्त्रणमा लिएर ब्यारेक गएको थियो । त्यसलगत्तै उनको हत्या भयो ।  
  
पक्राउ परेको भोलिपल्ट मैना अध्ययनरत विद्यालयका शिक्षक र छिमेकीसहित २५ जनाको टोली लामिडाँडास्थित ब्यारेकमा पुग्यो । त्यति बेला सेनाका अधिकारीले मैनालाई पक्राउ गरेको गुनासो अस्वीकार गरे । पाँचखाल ब्यारेकमा खोजतलासका क्रममा पनि मैना पक्राउ परेको भनी सेनाका अधिकारीहरूले लामो समयसम्म अस्वीकार गरे । पक्राउ परेर पाँचखाल ब्यारेकमै राखिएकी विमला विकले मैनालाई पक्राउपछि यातना दिइएको र त्यस क्रममा उनको मृत्यु भएको खुलासा गरिन् । परिवार, अधिकारकर्मी र प्रत्यक्षदर्शीहरूले सेनाकै अधिकारीहरूले उनलाई नियन्त्रणमा लिएको प्रमाण पेस गर्ने क्रम जारी रह्यो ।  
  
२०६१ असारतिर मैनाकी आमा तत्कालीन शाही नेपाली सेनाको मानव अधिकार सेलमा छोरीबारे गुनासो गर्न पुगेकी थिइन् । त्यस क्रममा एक सैनिक अधिकारीले पक्राउ परेकी मैना गाडीबाट भाग्ने प्रयास गरेपछि गोली लागेर मरेको र उनको शवलगायत बरामद सामान काभ्रे प्रहरीमा पुगिसकेको बताएका थिए । त्यस क्रममा उनले मैनाको घोप्टो परेको शवको फोटो पनि देखाए । प्रहरीले भने सेनाबाट कुनै पत्राचार नभएको र शव पनि नआएको जवाफ दियो । मैनाको मृत्यु भएको प्रमाण तयार गर्न आरोपितहरूले यातनाका क्रममा उनको मृत्यु भएपछि ढाडमा गोली प्रहार गरेको मिसिलहरूमा उल्लेख छ ।  
  
पीडित परिवारको आग्रहमा राष्ट्रिय तथा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय मानव अधिकारकर्मीले चौतर्फी दबाब दिएपछि सेनाले घटनामा चासो दिन थाल्यो । सुरुमा सैनिक अधिकारीहरूले मैना पक्राउ परेपछि, गाडीमा ब्यारेकमा ल्याउने क्रममा होक्सेको जंगलबाट भाग्न खोज्दा सैनिकले प्रहार गरेको गोलीले उनको मृत्यु भएको जवाफ दिए । पछि चौतर्फी दबाब बढेपछि सेनाले इक्वायरी बोर्ड गठन गर्‍यो ।  
  
एक दशकभन्दा बढीको संघर्षपछि मुद्दाले नियमित अदालतमा प्रवेश पायो । २०७४ वैशाख ३ गते जिल्ला अदालत काभ्रेले नेपाली सेनाका तीन अधिकारीलाई जन्मकैदको फैसला सुनाएको थियो । जिल्ला न्यायाधीश मेदिनीप्रसाद पौडेलको इजलासले घरमा बसेकी किशोरीलाई गैरकानुनी रूपमा नियन्त्रणमा लिई ब्यारेकभित्र हत्या गरेको घटनामा महासेनानी बबि खत्री, सहसेनानीहरू अमिल पुन र सुनील अधिकारीलाई मुलुकी ऐनको ज्यानसम्बन्धी महलको १३ (३) अनुसार जन्मकैद हुने फैसला गरेको थियो ।  
  
फैसला कार्यान्वयन भएको छैन । मैनालाई नियन्त्रण लिएपछि ब्यारेकसम्म लैजाँदाका चालक सेनानी निरञ्जन बस्नेतलाई भने जिल्ला अदालतले सफाइ दिएको छ । बबि खत्री अवकाशपछि विदेशमा थिए भने अधिकारी र पुनले सैनिक सेवा छाडे । कर्तव्य ज्यानको मुद्दा लागेका बस्नेत सेनाका बहालवाला अधिकारी थिए ।

k9q0md,Who do you think killed King Birendra?,"A common thread in most conspiracy theories is the omnipotent, almighty ""they"". There are people who are convinced that the world is flat and ""they"" (NASA, US Government) are hiding it for some reason. They have bought everyone and everything. This context needs to be understood.

Most of the people that I have conversation with about the massacre are convinced that either RAW or Gyanendra killed Birendra and his family. It doesn't matter that all the eye witnesses, all the reports and investigations are saying that Dipendra did the killing. India has bought them all, they have threatened them is their goto answer for that.

 ""How could a son kill his own parents and family?"". This is another common argument. I think they look at the situation from their eyes and not from the eyes of someone who was brought up thinking he is a god and whose every wish was fulfilled. This definitely has an effect in your psychology.

Now, I'm not a RAW agent or Indian. And yes, I love my country. I have travelled this country from Mechi to Mahakali. **I just want to know the opinion of** r/nepal **on this**.

mrhxr6,"Is it okay if animal is killed in a ""humane"" way?","I have seen a lot of discussion on this sub lately about how animal rights if you will. Most of them come to conclusion that killing animals is bad. Some argue that other animals (like cow) should get same privilege as dogs so that their murder is met with same level of rage and protest as the death of a dog would raise.

Most people point out that it wasn't the ""killing"" that was the problem but the way the dog was killed. They further pointed that killing the dog or any animal in such brutal way wasn't acceptable on any grounds, be it meat or population control. I totally agreed with ""humane"" killing of animal (if that's a thing). For meat, just kill the animal in a blow: instant death, minimal pain (since poisoning isn't a way to kill animal for consumption). Most people I talk to kinda agree to that. I was just curious if this sub is okay with that and what it thinks about halal and halal certificates? Should it be opposed on the grounds of ""humane"" killings or is it okay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/mrhxr6/is_it_okay_if_animal_is_killed_in_a_humane_way/,4/15/2021 16:10,8,0,12,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

iqjw11,Why has meat258 not yet killed himself?,"A friend of mine asked me this question. He said ""hey meat258, you dont have any friends, you dont smoke, your life is so boring. You never get to try anything new. You are so dumb and people are disgusted by you. People think you have some sort of mental issues too and so everyone calls you a 'Boula'. If I were you, I would have killed myself long ago"" and other things. Though he was brave enough to ask me this question, I dont think he was the only one curious to know the answer. Because you know, it could be considered illegal to ask. But nevertheless, I decided to answer this question here.

First off, what makes people think you are a boula when you neither drink alcohol, nor do drugs and no, you dont go around biting people. I do none of those things.

You see, if you dont have job security in Nepal, it may not be so wise idea to go visit a psychiatrist because having any kind of record of diagnosis might make it difficult to find a job of your choice in the company of your choice. They may simply say ""you are unable to work"" when they see your medical records. I might go visit a psychiatrist once I am sure they cant kick me because of it.

I mean, if you ask people who have been diagnosed with mental issues, most of them either live and work outside the country or work govt. job in the country.

Yaah, I sometimes do believe that had I taken alcohol, it would have helped me relieve the stress but I have also seen its effects as my father used to be an alcoholic. I would rather die than take alcohol myself.

Enough of this nonsense, so why havent I killed myself? Its because I dont have to bother with killing myself. If the situation persists, I hope I will be dead within a decade from now, because in my opinion, its enough for someone to live upto 30. I find it funny when people say ""atleast I am alive"" and yet have nothing and crippling with debt like why should you think you should have been alive.

Or so I used to think, I dont know whom to blame for it other than myself. But in recent years and watching some Youtube videos, I dont know why? why should I make things more complicated? I mean, when you compare me with others, I am not even a smoker. You know, its never too late for anything, or so I think. But I dont know what to do, as a start.

People around me say if you kill yourself, according to Hindu sastra, you will not even get to eat ashes in the afterlife. Maby thats true. So I dont act in.

You should believe in something, you must, either Shiva, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, whoever, it doesnt matter, but you must believe in someone if you dont believe in anything than there will be no difference between you and an animal. And that makes you go insane. I am not asking you to just become a hermit but you need to believe enough.

The funny thing happened to me was I recently met a distant relative who only once saw me when I was a toddler was surprised how I was better than they thought, my question was obviously how are they able to make judgements about me when they have never seen me when I was growing up? I can only blame a few people for that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/iqjw11/why_has_meat258_not_yet_killed_himself/,9/11/2020 4:34,0,0,16,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

gx62cr,Don't know about Corona but the government will sure kill me with it's atrocities every now and then.,"It all started when Nepal became republic of political parties. No, not People. It never was. The way all these politicians have been behaving like Kings and Queens themselves all this time.

Corruption that can destroy a nation. Syndicate everywhere. Police brutality we see every day. Playing deaf and blind to people's problems like imposing tax as it is despite the freaking pandemic shutting everything down.

I mean, I have no trust in any of the older heads in our politics. They are simply on honeymoon period after being oppressed or challenged by the His Majesty Government all their youth. How come Deuba who was sacked twice by the King as incompetent still be president of biggest so called democratic party of Nepal. How are we supposed to get anything from them? Even someone, at least clever he appears, like Gagan Thapa remains waiting for his chance in syndicate.

There is a reason a China or a India have no respect for us because these idiots represent us. They don't even have basic understanding of diplomacy. Nepal is gold mine, it's natural resources can be used to make one of the richest country of the world. It needs a statesman to crack diplomatic deal with these big countries. But no, our lazy mfs only want charities.

I don't know, a big part of problem is it's citizens too.

There was outrage for Lipulekh, or that stupid Indian web series Pataal Lok but we will not rant over atrociously imposed taxes. Where have the celebrities gone now?

Until and unless something like RTI is activated sincerely nothing can change. Until public is not able to chose it's own PM, it is unlikely anything will change in this country for the generation of current old politicians.

Youths of these nation lacks leadership. Or even if there is one independent somewhere, he has been politicized for no reason. And that individual is not able to come out as independent.

We don't relate to old politicians. No one understands them or there is nothing to be understood. They are outdated. 

I have personally felt trauma caused by Police misusing their power, government job remains the trauma for most kids growing up, coz entrepreneurship is not entertained in this country. My office where I work (to be former soon) has done inhumane things that gets no mention coz the owners have links with high powers and for some staffs it's normal. Our GDP is so less that none of us are allowed to dream or have wings. They laugh at you.

Study 11-12 from a biological science background. Prepare for entrance. If cleared; study medicine. If failed; drop a year and prepare again. Get into medical college. Get ragged by seniors. Follow senior etiquette. Do practical notes of seniors. study 19 subjects throughout 5.5 years. Go to field trips(Well; that's fun). Find out that a dog's life is much easier and wish you were one. Grind your a55 off to pass the exams. Work 14 hours continuously everyday for a minimum wage of 20k for more than half a year as internship. Again grind your a55 off for NMCLE (license exams). Then work for government job at a rural area for 1 year or 2 depending on you studied self-funded or government-funded scheme.  


Then again, prepare for CEE PG because you want to stay in Nepal and not go to US, Aus or Ind. Prepare for the entrance which is much harder than the UG entrance. Then clear the entrance exam and begin as a resident doctor. Do you think life would be easy by this point? Pff.... Not yet.  
Follow these rules and regulations: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw75pJpIaEI/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw75pJpIaEI/)  
and stay silent for 3 years. Yup. Only 15 days holidays throughout the whole year. You are expected to be a machine and never fall sick too. Then start working at a hospital with a pay of something about 1.5 lakh monthly. Your friends, who went abroad after clearing 12th are decently earning above 5000$, can save a huge chunk and you're here serving people for a mere 1000$.   


You're helping people now. Is it satisfying? Wait..... You won, but at what cost?  
You lost 6 years of early 20s on studying for bachelor's degree. Then, 2 years for bonding/rural-posting. Then 3 years for Residency. That too if you cleared all exams on the first try itself. If not; you might have to drop some years to reach here. That means; you're 30+ y-old, have a bachelors degree; a specialization and some loans probably.  
**You'll be threatened and beaten up by people enraged by the death/severity of their relative who is admitted. You can make no mistakes. You're a doctor. You'll have to take care of your patients and their family and their relatives and their neighbor; everybody's mental well-being coz you never know when and by whom you're going to get attacked.**  
It was 10 years ago when people actually respected doctors. Nobody respects doctors now.  
You came in this field to save lives. But look at you now. You're trying to save your own life from these bullish dunks who can accuse you of killing someone whom you actually tried your best to save. Yes; murder charges pressed against doctors sometimes.   


Well, no need to get scared. That's the severity of choosing medicine and you chose to be here.

1ekrlzw,Student revolution in Bangladesh and can it impact Nepal?,"Today Sheikh Hasina along with her authoritarian government toppled with her fleeing the country after killing over 300 students. A protest that started against the quota system(with few similarities to Nepal's quota system) where normal students were deprived of getting government jobs after graduation turned into a full-scale revolution. Sheikh Hasina, who was in power for over 20 years, displayed an unprecedented level of control and power throughout her tenure, including silencing her critics by any means necessary.

Though the Bangladesh economy under her leadership a few years back showed some great promise it all started crashing down just in a couple of months. These protests against her government were nothing new and had gone violent many times. This time though her regime showed no mercy and systematically tried to display a dictatorship in hopes of completely silencing the protest. But students dint stop even after the Supreme Court ordered to fully abolish the quota system as they demanded her resignation alongside punishment for her crimes.

Now since being in South Asia this movement can have a bigger impact on Nepal too. Not long ago something similar happened in Sri Lanka where people were fed up with the status quo and decided to topple the whole regime. I believe if the current three parties which have been handing power to one another turn by turn dont change in the next few years it cannot be ruled out that similar circumstances can happen inside Nepal too.

15r7r8d,I failed .,"I'm lost and hopeless. I have no clue how I could repair this in my lifetime. I'm miserable and unlikeable.

Please hold on to me, this one is longggggg. There's a tl;dr at the end though.

When I was a kid, I thought studying was the hard part about life, probably just like most of you as well. But as time went on it became increasingly clear that failing in studies isn't as big of a deal like failing in some other aspect of life.

I'm almost out of undergrad now but in 20+ years with almost no hardships I'm starting to fall to my knees in defeat. I wasn't much of a competition person although every person wants to win at something as an innate nature. I don't like comparing myself to others but this time I just can't help it.

I never had a ""best friend"" as a child. It's not because I didn't want one. Everyone seemed better off. Fast forward to today, I certainly am not the caving-in introvert I used to be when I joined university and yet I feel extremely hollow. I couldn't make even a single lasting connection/ heartwarming friendship throughout my high school/college/university. Sure I know and talk to a bunch of people from campus. I participate in small talks all the time as a part of my own deliberate effort at making friends but in all these years, all the ""friendships"" I've had were totally surface-level.

I see classmates who are actually friends with each other, how they treat each other and immediately it burns the spark of what a friendship looks like. When I look at my interactions with other people, I can't help but notice that I'm doing something wrong. What is it that I lack in my persona which prevents me from having an actual friendship. If anything I'm that one person who everyone knows but nobody invites to their party. I've tried getting opinions from others about whether I lacked something as a person but everyone shrugs it off with a ""you're fine"" but then again maybe they'd tell me the truth if I was actually their friend?

I didn't let this bother me for the longest time, even when most books, threads, articles are about having fun with ""friends and family"". After graduating, the most important people are friends but I don't think a single person from my class would remember my existence a month after passing out. I've never argued with anyone, badmouthed anyone or harmed any of my known people. I deliberately try to have the nicest and yet the most genuine interaction with them. I try not to try too had. I just let myself loose and open up and yet on the retrospect it feels wasted/ perhaps not enough?

One of the reasons here is certainly me being way too ""sojho"" for the current society. I don't know why I'm so clueless but everyone around me knows exactly what they are doing. It's like a movie clip where a guy is standing in the middle of a crossroad while the people walk to and fro in fast forward. I've tried watching tons of movies/ series and reading books just to maybe learn how friendships grow. Maybe I just don't know something that they do? But no, nothing worked. I tell myself ""you're trying too hard, this shit should be effortless"" and then I stop thinking about it and just be myself for some time which doesn't seem to make me capable of true friendship though.

Social media exacerbates this even further with pictures/videos of people goofing around, visiting places, tagging in memes, etc but when I try to make similar plans they fall right through because the other party doesn't show similar interest in most cases. I cope with it assuming they all might be busy but it's not supposed to be every time right?

And it's not that I haven't been among a certain type of people. I have experienced the company of a wide spectrum of people, of different views, different expectations, different backgrounds and yet none of that seems to make a difference when it comes to me. 

Let me not even get started on relationships. It's a disaster in that department as well, as you might have guessed. They would mostly get creeped out and leave. But I never bring up taboo topics while talking to the opposite gender and try to remain as humble and respectful as I possibly can. One thing I admittedly need to work on is just what I'm doing right now. Ranting and complaining. Aru lai ta nagari ni pugya xa ta. Why am I like this? It just comes full circle. Maybe it's just that I'm incredibly unattractive and downright repulsive, but my grandma would disagree. But what good is that, it is I who is struggling in interpersonal relations.

My communication skills, apart from ranting and complaining, are completely trash and that has been my primary area of focus during my time at uni but now that it's coming to an end, I don't know how I can proceed.

I was originally planning to go to the US for graduate studies but looking at my state of interpersonal health I'm thinking of backing off and maybe just trying Loksewa here. I've seen people say that the only thing that has kept them afloat abroad is their friend circle and the fun they have. It's about 3 am right now, or my venting hour... I usually don't stay up this late but this feeling has been eating me up from the inside for a while and I just had to jot it down for everyone to see and maybe suggest me some stuff or maybe share their own stories.

Even though you're the polar opposite to me, with deep, nurturing friendships, childhood best friends who you'll be for life, and a loving partner, I'd like to hear what your stories were/ what you think of this situation? I'll not judge anyone for calling me pathetic here because I can't find any words other than naive and pathetic to describe myself in this situation.

Sorry for such a long thread. Thanks for reading to the end though. Much love and have a good day!

tl;dr: I have no friends and it's killing me from the inside. I don't know what to do. Please provide any form of advice. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/15r7r8d/i_failed/,8/14/2023 21:30,128,0,105,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

1dnbusp,Guys in my class are  unbelievably misogynistic (what the actual fuck is up with Nepalese guys these days),"(Please consider by nepalese guys I meant guys in my class specifically, I was very angry when I wrote this) 

Lets start with some context, I just finished my 12th and am currently studying in an institute. Everything was going great until one teacher showed up. I respect him a lot, all the sutdents do but he passes a lot of misogynistic comments. Yea I know how to take a joke blablabla but listening to this old man fucking yap about how girls do this or that and stereotype them every fucking day is tiring. I study hard and I would say I'm pretty smart in academics as well and I know I shouldn't take it personally but it fucking ruins my mood listening to the same shit everyday. The bigger problem here is the guys, I can't believe they will someday work for the country with a fucking clown mindset. They pass 10202292919910 comments about girls then complain how feminists these days are over reacting. I know they probably don't care but I hope all of them have a daughter someday so they will understand what the fuck is wrong with them. Also almost all of the guys in my class make girls feel uncomfortable as far as I have heard. I hope one day the teacher or one of those guys says something misogynistic to me so I can be personally offended and throw a fucking shoe at them.

Anyways ty for listening to my rant. I hope any girl or guy that comes across this realizes the joke becomes fucking annoying when you repeat it every day and keep stereotyping women.



Edit : I don't know if I should be sad or happy right now. It makes me upset that so many girls relate with this on the other hand I am so thankful to all the girlies and the guys here who actually seem like decent people and are suporting me. The thread lowkey gives me hope after I have had a shit day in general (a lot of things have gone wrong for me today).

She was rote learning again. I overheard she was mugging up the definition of PowerPoint and its uses so I stepped in and explained what PowerPoint is. 

She instantly said, ""yesari lekhena bhaney ka marks auxa ta"". .

wsw2ju,What in the actual fuck!,"Now, this might trigger some people. If it does fuck you and your beliefs!

So last night I went to a Radha Krishna Temple. I thought Hindus are fucking crazy, the celebration never ends. I felt goosebumps and pride when Lakhey music, the sound of sankha and the bells were ringing together. I was like this is the best fucking thing I experienced in life. I generally don't worship or go to the temple. Last night I wanted to go and fortunately, it was worth it. I was proud of being a Hindu. For a moment I forgot the stakes in the biggest Hindu population country. Now, this morning I opened Facebook, well, I don't have any words for the idiocracy of India. I don't give a flying fuck what's going on in that country. I have always seen a huge potential in that country and think it's going to develop soon but for them, I don't know what has stuck up in their ass, everything for them is Hindu vs Muslim, ooh they hurt my big ass Hindu sentiments. Any statement by any celebrity is offensive, being a Muslim is offensive. They don't have any issues with fraud babas tho because they are Hindu. Hindu babas can rape Muslim girls and they walk free. The cherry on the top is they get Garlands when they come out because idk maybe they raped Muslims? Now few comments were asserting why should they help Muslim girls if Muslims themselves don't have the guts to protest the matters of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Like dude, I never thought Hinduism can be this toxic. Now every day I pray to that non-existent god that this toxicity never enters Nepal.

The boy and girl met at club drinking partying all night and they exchange phone number and make out. The boy thinks that both were above 18 because they met at club.

I would like to give some suggestion regarding this issue. 
I know we do what the law says and there's no if and buts. 
But we could make the correction to the law of +- theory. The age gap between them should be kept in mind. The boy's age doesn't necessarily mean that he is all matured and stuff compared to the girl who is just 6 month younger.

I dnt know why the fuck do i have to pay extra to give trial when the payments are done before. 
Plus 400 for 15 mins practice wow, absolutely wow
While giving trial i crossed everything and while i was doing u turn i saw a man arguing with the traffic at ukalo, he was blocking me so since i was confused and dont know what to do i looked back at the other traffic and he said to wait so i stopped before the bouncy road or whatever u call it, while i was waiting the other traffic looked back at me and said i FAILED because listen to me...... That traffic didn't told me to stop. Yeah fucking dickhead cuz you were busy arguing with that guy. I protested and started arguing but no one would listen. 
I went outside wrote a letter for request to look at the camera and see whos wrong but when i gave that to them they refused to take it which was my RIGHT !
One traffic literally said ""esto alxi kaam kina garne? Pachi dina au na"" I argued and one man literally said "" I will make sure you cannot give trial ever again so leave""
I am fucking done with every nepali system every nepali corrupted dickheads and the way they try to loot us with their power
Fuck this country i cant !


Update: And guess their reason of why 70 percent pass rule is not yet done in Kathmandu but everywhere else. Because according to their logic since most number of people in ktm have registered for liscene so right now 1 person need avg 1 min to pass trial so if 70 percent rule comes then it takes around 2-3 min per person ani time dherai lagxa re!!
Woww totall dickheads on top making rules, paisa haat bata najaos vandai ma j ni vandine muji haru
Rn ktm ma pass rate 24 percent xa re for bike and most fail because of minor mistakes so if 70 percent rule is not applied then the same people with minor mistakes will keep coming to the center increasing the number and making no fucking change!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/vdh1f9/nepal_liscene_riggedwhole_nepali_system_fucked/,6/16/2022 8:20,85,0,59,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

iyxccr,My life is a fucked up mess.,"It's been over a year since I got my degree. I was an average student, but I excel at doing what I learned over the years in the actual field. I gained experience during the four years of my Bachelor's. However, since I got my degree, I have only done a couple of small gigs. I am not bragging, I am not, but I am good at what I do. Even if I don't know something, I ask people - to learn. I have applied to internships, volunteer works, full-time jobs over the last several months. The number is already in the hundreds. However, I only got called for three interviews, and they wanted a more experienced person. I got that, I understood. So, I tried to make myself better.

But all that effort has turned out to be pointless. I am home most of the time. I have asked loads to people if they can help me find jobs - which is wrong, I know - but it sucks when someone who hasn't done shit in their life gets a good position in a company, you know? It really sucks. And for the last few months, I have been feeling shitty about myself, feeling shitty about my decision to join that subject five years ago. Nowadays, every job I apply to only makes me sad. I know they will not select me. I feel like all those years I worked my ass off to gain experience has gone down the drain.

What was the fucking point of doing all that? No point at all. My shitty mind made me leave a person who loved me dearly. They used to understand what I was going through, but I still left. I am a bad person. So, nowadays, I sit on my bed the whole day regretting my decision to invest my time in a thing that has only degraded my mental health. I think it will be better for me to leave this sector and join another one. But every fucking day, I wake up thinking maybe today's my day, you know? Maybe someone will finally send me that email, asking me to join an interview. But that's just a dream. So, I think of giving my life up, maybe that will stop all of this completely, but I can't. I know it will only cause pain to my family.

I don't know what I am supposed to do. Everything sucks. I don't even know why I am writing this here. I just wanted someone to listen, I guess. I used to laugh at people who said the same old ""growing up sucks."" Now I understand it. I really do haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/iyxccr/my_life_is_a_fucked_up_mess/,9/24/2020 13:33,16,0,27,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

Because there was an instagram icon in the template itself and whichever son of a bitch built that website didn't even put enough effort to remove one fucking hyperlink from the footer.

18syqbk,Why do Nepalese have literally no sense of social awareness,"I mean this in the most non-demeaning way; why are the general Nepalese public so f ing dumb. Basic social values (not spitting on the road, not littering, not climbing on statues) are rare as fuck. Even people from countries which have a similar economic and social standing to Nepal like Cambodia, Laos (yes, I've been to those places) are light years cleaner and more socially aware than the average Nepali. I was on the bus one day when the person next to me tried to throw a wrapper out of the window. I told him not to do that, and that I would rather take it home and throw it out for him instead, and he looked as if he was going to fucking explode. I've seen numerous times people climbing on statues and taking pictures even when there were signs explicitly stating against both of those things. Social values which are 1 in 100 in Nepal are 40 in 100 in Cambodia, 60 in 100 in Thailand, and almost 100 in 100 in Germany and Japan. What the fuck is wrong with the people here? Is it the Indian influence? Or is it something that has always been? Sometimes I wish we got a benovelent dictator or gotten invaded by China just to straighten these people out. It is high time we come to terms with the fact that Nepalese people are too stupid to function under a democracy, we need strict rules to deal with these people, even if it means assigning harsh punishments for smaller offences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18syqbk/why_do_nepalese_have_literally_no_sense_of_social/,12/28/2023 17:02,182,0,133,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

1ev6w1m,Advice needed :) How to spend my remaining 8 days in Nepal,"Hey everyone, I’m a Canadian spending 30 days in Nepal. Love it so far!! 

I arrived on Thursday and spent two days in Thamel. I’m currently on a 7-day Gosaikunda trek. I get back to KTM on the 22nd and then I start a yoga retreat on August 31st. So I’m looking for advice on how to spend those 8 days/9 nights - thinking just Pokhara and KTM, but not sure how to split the days up.

I’d appreciate suggestions on things to do in Pokhara and where to stay in Kathmandu! 

A few details 
- I’m going to fly to/from Pokhara - possibly 23 or 24th (idk if I’ll want 1 or 2 days after my trek to chill) 
- I don’t necessarily need to trek again in Pokhara but I’d be open to a day or two of Poon if the weather is good (assuming it’s won’t be) 
- I’m happy just exploring, eating good food, and reading in cute coffee shops. I don’t need to cram a lot of activities in, would rather a more laid back pace. 
- In Kathmandu, I don’t need to go back to Thamel. Very touristy. Any other must-see areas? I’m thinking of staying near Boudha area before I go to Pokhara.  And then my yoga retreat departs from near Tribeni Chowk Kapan.

Earthquake affected people in jajarkot are dying on a daily basis due to cold.","The TikTok ban has garnered more attention and concern, overshadowing the tragic deaths of real people in Jajarkot due to seemingly mundane causes like the ""cold."" It is disheartening that such basic conditions lead to fatalities, especially when the weather is not excessively harsh, like -10 degrees Celsius. The government remains indifferent, as has been the case for a long time, and expectations for positive action are low. However, the societal response is perplexing. Why is there a lack of support, even in providing essential clothing for those already devastated by earthquakes?

We’d been planning this trip for months, and I felt confident we’d all look out for each other. But at around 4200 meters, everything changed. They know I’m a bit slower on steep hikes, but I always make it eventually. Instead of pacing with me or waiting, they just kept moving forward.

I thought they’d eventually stop to let me catch up or at least give me a call. We had network coverage, so it wouldn’t have been hard to check in. But even though they knew I was back there alone, they didn’t reach out once. By the time I got to the viewpoint, exhausted, I realized they’d gone all the way to base camp.

I felt truly abandoned, but then strangers on the trail noticed my struggle and stepped in to help. They shared water, checked if I needed medicine and honestly cared about how I was doing. I still can’t wrap my head around how people I barely knew were there for me more than my own friends.

I was so hurt that I didn’t wait for them to come back. I made my way home alone because I just couldn’t face them. I haven’t been able to stop thinking, *What if something had happened to me? What if I had died out there?* The tears haven’t stopped, and I’m still so shaken up. I keep having nightmares about falling off the mountain, and I can’t bring myself to tell my parents because I don’t want them to worry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1gbqu5h/left_alone_by_friends_at_4200m_on_mardi_himal/,10/25/2024 10:12,574,0,163,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

mjohv1,My bully died in an accident.,"That guy was real pain in the ass during grade 9 and 10. I studied in a government school where most poor goes. He was richest on the school and along with him, few others used to make my entire day shitty. For me, it was kind of routine to get bullied by them. 

A particular example of bully is about the appearance.
And if you did or been victim, one of irritating moment is, sitting more than 1 bullies in back bench and hitting on head of guy in front seat then making normal faces. When you turn around to see who did that, you wont be able to blame anyone. I still remember those moments and use to think that if I ever found a time machine then I would like to do the same. 

Today on early morning, one guy told me that my bully died in bike accident. He told me that he used to take drugs and lots of weed. 

After nearly 10 years later, I was in delimma for some moments whether I have to show sympathy or relief. But later realized that karma is not a bitch.

It makes us feel like they don't give a damn whether we live or die. The whole system is standing like just spectators rather than taking control of the situation.

If we are on our own, then what's the use of government & it's bureaucratic system? We all have known that the system is corrupt for long, but corruption in procurement of medical supplies and vaccines? Simply Pathetic and sheer dislay of contemptible cowardice. Maybe, more than the virus & the hunger, corruption is more endemic which would let us die helplessly & make us feel responsible for our own deaths.

10o6x52,Is it Rock Music or rock fans dying in Nepal?,"We had our own classic rock songs back in the 90s, then started to grow Alternative Rock / All Metal genre in the early 2000s up until around 2007-08.

And last few years between 2015 - now 2023, Indie rock is growing a lot! but still very very low (if) compared to HipHop/Rap fans here in Nepal when you see the views of music videos on those genre. Let's not even talk about Dohori/Nepali Dance/Nepali film songs here. I'm just talking about all genre Rock and Metal music and fans of Nepal and Nepalese overseas. What really is happening guys if you're into rock/metal? Of course we had Band Champion last year and it did bring some help to the rock/genre communities but still very very low. Don't you support the bands/artist like how Hiphop fans have been doing/making communities. Other countries such as US/Japan/Some European/Asian countries have been already started to bring back Rock and Metal music back to life. They buy albums/go to concert/buy merchandise/make communities/share music etc.

About 2 weeks ago, I put the post here about 2022 Nepali Non-Love Rock Songs Top 30 and views are just too low. (Look, I am not promoting my channel, to be honest, In fact I don't even get anything from it actually, I am just supporting the artist/bands, that's all, the channel isn't even monetized), With such low views not only on those videos but to the Actual Artist/Bands videos, It really seem that it's the Nepalese rock/metal fans who are dying rather than the bands/artist who have been making really good music these days.

So what's your opinion about Nepalese rock/metal artist/bands and their fans? what really needs to bring back those rock/metal era? What is lacking? Don't want to blame the generation as it's all over the world but in Nepal, these rock/metal genre is not catching up to the certain level where even rock artist/bands feel/ask when will this genre be finally back on the track.

For those who might want to discover 2022 Nepali Rock/Metal songs Top 30 (Both Love and Non-Love songs), here it is,

p19021,Think I'm dying and am scared shitless,"Been here before.

Smoked a lot of cigarettes back when I was in high school. Got caught twice still did not stop. Quit since the first lockdown but it's still on and off. Now I have this intense pain running down my chest and I think it's cancer. I know it probably is not and is some other trivial stuff that can be easily treated but I'm scared shitless.

Been this way my entire life. Don't think of the consequences while doing the action and later freak the fuck out and think life is unfair and why do I have to bear all the consequences. Never got on well with people. Never been in a relationship. Never had a ""best friend"". Never spoke with my parents  apart from the absolutely necessary stuff and the usual bhat khana aija and stuff. Now that I feel like I'm dying (which I'm pretty sure I'm not) I can't think of anything good about my life. I've been here multiple times (The I'm about to die part) and I'm sure I'm gonna be the same after I go to the hospital and find out it's nothing.

Don't see my life changing no matter what I do. No matter how hard I try, how good I try to become I always fuck up. Then comes the self loathing and hatred. It's like there's  two people inside my brain(not bipolar or anything like that I'm talking about the way I shit on myself). Man I hate myself. I hate the way I  eat, the way I look, the things I do , the relationships I've built. There isn't a single aspect of my life where I can say yeah I'm proud of myself there.

These moments come every 6 months or so where I think I'm gonna die and if I survive I'll turn my life around. I'll start studying do this do that. In the end I forget about how I'm feeling like right now and go back to my usual life. 

Why am I writing this you ask? Cause I have nobody to tell this to. Like literally nobody. Don't have any friends. Kinda sad but it's been this way for 2 years now.  Honestly I just don't know what to do anymore. It feels like my life has no impact on this planet. Not even the smallest bit. If I die tomorrow my parents are gonna cry for a week maybe then things will go back to normal. Nothing would have changed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/p19021/think_im_dying_and_am_scared_shitless/,8/9/2021 19:49,1,0,1,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

18ergqb,Why are Nepali so keen moving abroad?,"Yesterday I met a 40 years old man desperate to move abroad. He works in a food delivery company in Kathmandu. He has a beautiful wife and a daughter, aged 10 years old. He is even going to the extent of using illegal routes to get into USA. I was distraught.

Nepal has a large population base. 3 crore population is not a joke. Can't we do something here itself?Is moving abroad a only solution we are looking for? Life in abroad isn't as easy as one dreams of. You will be treated as second class citizen. You will be fighting hard just to maintain legal status there.

Studies here aren't great. Many people move abroad for that. But people dying in Russia just to get Russian citizenship. Things aren't looking great here.

Edit: This food delivery guy owns 5 bighas of ancestral property in Jhapa and is planning to sell that land to fund the trip. Can't he just move back to his village and work in his farm? I couldn't bring myself up to put forth that argument as he was so adamant to move out. He knows the risk and consequences , he might be deported the moment he arrives there. But he feels the risk is worth taking for his stable future.

Edit no 2: Then there are people who are pointing out that I belong to a rich family and I don't understand the hardships of common man. This is rubbish. I am a hard working student currently pursuing Civil engineering in Pulchowk. You don't have to be from a very rich family or have political connections to sustain here. I made 5 lakhs in 2077 Stock market boom just by investing 1 lakhs; I returned that 1 lakhs to my parents and bought 5 tolas of gold for my future wedding. 

The real question comes to how much you are conscious of the opportunities the market is providing you? How much effort you are putting in to sustain here? Political corrections are required but running away from problem is not the ultimate solution. Yes, I will move out to pursue my Masters program but I will return back to serve my country with the expertise I will learn abroad. Just blaming the system won't bring changes, one has to put in effort as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18ergqb/why_are_nepali_so_keen_moving_abroad/,12/10/2023 0:41,117,0,117,English,1,0,1,0,0,2

But I plan to bring her here permanently  after few years. And I also hesitate to get it because I don't know the terms for NRNs in Nepal. My Question is how long can an NRN stay in Nepal without having to leave Nepal? Also what are the property and inheritance implications for NRNs? I'm worried if one day god forbids my mum passes away my uncle will take my mum's hard earned property. I don't care for the property in Nepal but I really don't want my uncle to have it because he stole our share of inheritance a week after my dad died 19 years ago. He's also one of the reasons my dad died in the first place. Not only that he tried to take over my widow mum's house which she built with her own money and hardwork at one point through a lawsuit. Bottom line is I don't want my uncle to get my mum's house after my mum's passing If I were to be an Australian citizen because  that is the house I grew up in and my mum loves it to bits. I would not be able to forgive myself if something like that happened. Please let me know if you know of any implications.

TLDR: How to protect my mum's house from my scumbag uncle if I 'her only son' becomes an Australian citizen and revokes his Nepalese Citizenship?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1grlti8/australian_or_nepalese_citizenship/,11/15/2024 2:14,56,0,49,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

18b4nmp,Am I safe ?,"Well , Yo sabai  started a few months ago. It was really small things at first hai , like stuff that anyone could dismiss as nothing as I did . 
Sooo at first , there was ekdamai light tapping and scratching on the walls it sounds  atti nai filmy wala shitttt , but hear me outtt , I would notice things being displaced around the house (I'm extremely forgetful of things  , so it wouldn't be a surprise it I was the one misplacing them).
Ani after some days,  the tapping became more focused and happened during the day like tf . It actually sounded like someone was using their fingers to tap on the walls  k ! ( it’s cement ko wall tara being  a very conscious individual , I could  still tell fr ) ani it would seem to be coming from just around the corners in the house, as if someone was standing there just out of view. Ani  of course , like anyy bhoot ko film , as soon as I would get up to investigate it would stop immediately and nobody would be there.
( kehi din pachi ) 
Now, after some days of weird ass and scary experiences my breath was fkin taken away the night that I finally saw something. I was on my bed, using my phone like I always do before nidaying , when I heard the tapping again. I looked at the source of the noise, almost getting used to it by now and not really being fazed by it. However, just as I looked over, I could see what looked like a black silhouette( which I always encountered since I was baccha but this was different ) it had these huge eyeballs with black pupils, and as soon as I spotted it, it backed up around the corner disappearing from my sight.( now the silhouettes I encountered before throughout  my life , were simply just black shadows floating around , it had no physical structure , no hands or legs no eyes or mouth , it would just be a miserable black shadow, almost harmless  ) 
It all happened so fast hai that it was kind of hard to really figure out what I saw, tara I remember my heart absolutely sinking when I saw it. For a few seconds I couldn't even move ( khai dar lae ho ki shock lae ho ) , but I finally gathered up the nerve to get up, and I couldn't find anyone in the room ra house . I searched literally everywhere.

Tespachi , the craziest thing happened, nothing at all. For about 3 or 4 weeks, nothing odd happened in that house. Like kei pani nai k ! Normal sabai normal !! 
I didn't hear the tapping, nothing was misplaced. I started to feel somewhat normal again. I somehow rationalize that whatever it was, since I finally noticed it, perhap it decided to stop and I in other way I also kept telling myself ki maybe I imagined it alllll afteralll ( like everyone always says I do , S**** “you’re kasto paranoid k “) tara at the back of my mind it made more sense  to me that what if it wanted to mess with me??????? ( I know these creatures yalll , esto jhukyauna  khojxa ni ma kassam) or maybe since tyo creature (or whatever in the world that was) ko cover was blown, ani had to move on or decided to do so ! 

Tara I was wrong, soooo dukin wrongggggg !!!!  All of the sudden haii one night, I was on my laptop doing whatever, and I heard the tapping again k ! ekxin ko lagi ta I had forgotten about what had happened to me in those past few months !!  
Now as I realized ,  what I saw the last time I looked, I couldn't bring my self to look in the direction. I was  almostttt frozen. It stopped after a few seconds, but I was on edge the rest of the night, and truly from then on I was constantly nervous.( I couldn’t tell my parents , because they’d never believe me , I also couldn’t call my only dear friends d****** or  a**** ,  because p*****  is not mentally well herself and a**** lives far away ani time difference lae garda it’s difficult besides , mero dimag ma ni aairathiena phone garxu vhanera !!! ) 
Now , before  I knew it , things were getting truly out of hand. The torch would turn on in the middle of the night with static noise( it was my hajurbaus)  I would hear footsteps walk, and sometimes it could hear it  run down my hallway ( like purelyyy bhool Bhulaiya wala shit k ) !! It wasn't long before I started to see it again. It was popping up more and more, sometimes out of the corner of my eye, like those normal shadow I used to encounter before  and sometimes right in front of me like ffs k , I was going to bed every single night as a sweaty nervous wreck like being a Hindu it’s embarrassing k One time I even caught it peeking over the foot of my bed at me while I was trying to fall asleep. ( or maybe it was just post effect hallucinations of the situation I’d been through ) 
It all came to a boiling point the day before yesterday. I had already seen the thing about 4 or 5 times in the last few hours लाइक wtf , and I was shaking, in a more anxious state then ever. Then finally, after all this time, I heard it speak !!!!!!
not words to be exact. but in sort of frequencies jastoo ( dk if that makes sense tara fr ) 
I felt a cool, no, noo , more like a freezing cold breath on my cheek and simultaneously I heard a whisper in my ear  !!! right in my earrrrr (againnn its frequencies and vibrations , no words ) almost as if it was communicating and trying to make me aware of its presence being near ! 
I couldn't take it. I bolted and raged , heading towards the door, the only thing I could think to do was run tf out of the room , It was just pure instinct to stay away from that shit from messing my head any further at this point, but as soon as I stepped out of my room , I felt it gaining on me likeeee tfff It was right on my heel and I mean as close as it could possibly be. I ran out into the hallway , and before I knew it, I was face down on the marveled concrete floor bleeding all over. I looked up to see stairway  in front me. ( id literally die or atleast break a bone or two if I actually fell  from the stairs because the position I was in was reallly akward and vulnerableeee)!! 

It was about that time I realized what had happened. The last thing I remember  was that thing peeking outside my room , looking at me.
 
Since that it has  been a month or two y’all! 
I haven't seen the thing or had anything odd happen , even when I've been all alone. So maybe it stayed in the house and decided not to mess around !! Well , tbh I’ve started to rationalize it in my head thinking it was all in my head or just a bad dreammmm , and non of it was real vhanera like I always do !

Note to all christian of nepal i am not spreading hate speech just speaking some fact and some of views ans story i found online., so lets talk when did christian arive in nepal the christian missionaries first arrived in Nepal in the 17th century,

# Reasons for Their Arrival: The primary motive of these early missionaries was to spread Christianity. The Jesuits and later Protestant missionaries saw Nepal as a region untouched by Christianity, presenting an opportunity for conversion and expansion of the faith.

now you may ask why are u even making this doesnt a person allowed to choose their own religion yes they can but they should not force other ppl to convert to it and u may what force? so imma tell u a sort story so a frnd of mine like he was a close frnd of mine told me this the parents were hindus so was he but in a accident his father died and after we finished his father all ritual the christian ppl near his house stated to visit his mother regularly which his mom hated this went on for few month and one day the passtor of that chruh came in their with his nun he staright up took her to the chruh force her to drink some water and what u say that baptize her and he forced her to read bible after that day the mother and son leaved her village sold all her property there and came in city which left the mom traumatize and my frnd started to hate christian from that day on. on lets say with him we went to many places where similar thing and we found more than 10 of them and we also found a christian group in a discord talking about rioting in some places converting ppl by force. and we found many hideous video.and they are also targetting  literally target tyo financially challenged gau ko manchhe haru to make the convert to christianity

The amount of victim bashing is appalling. In an ideal society, Paul Shah should've been cancelled, but here the victim is cancelled. I honestly have no hope for anything good in Nepali society for couple of more generations.

10gachb,Visiting Pashupatinath for Maha Shivratri as a foreign traveler - Advice please,"Hello all,

I also posted this in r/Nepal but received no response so forgive me if this is the wrong place to post my question:

I will be traveling to Kathmandu in February (first time in Nepal!) and could use some local advice. I will be there in time for Maha Shivaratri and I am told it will be an amazing experience to visit Pashupatinath. I understand that it is an all-night festival on February 18, but I am confused about one thing: do the celebrations actually start on the night of Feb. 17/18 or is it the night of Feb. 18/19?

Also, do you think it would be better to book a guesthouse in Thamel and just take a taxi to Pashupatinath and back, or should I try and find accommodations closer to the temple? I imagine the streets will be very busy or closed, so maybe staying somewhere within walking distance will be best?

Do you have any other advice for how to best experience Maha Shivaratri in a respectful way, especially as a non-Hindu foreign traveler? Are there any safety concerns I should be aware of?

1cpgyy6,Gagan Thapa's political career is just him complaining,"At this point, I find Gagan Thapa too irritating. The dude has been complaining day and night for the past two months since his party came out of government. I mean, his party was in power until two months ago, but he didn't speak much during that time. Now, he's trying to act like a messiah. We're not always supposed to feel sympathy for this guy. As far as I remember, he always says, 'I am good, but my party doesn't let me reach the top position,' blah blah. This has been his stance for the past decade. We can't always sympathize with him. Jaile pani yei party khattam bho bachaunu parcha bhancha but guff bahek kei chaina. Suru ma ta ho bhanumla but this has been going on since ages.

Also, I agree with some people saying he is jealous. Of course, he is. The only ministry achievement he has had so far is becoming Health Minister once. That's it. Nothing else. But here, Rabi Lamichhane has grabbed the Home Ministry not just once but twice. The same goes for other Congress leaders like Biswo Prakash and Pradip Poudel. Last month Pradip Paudel was giving dialouge to Sumana Shrestha about how Rajniti is ruining TU. Unharu kei rajniti practices haru le aaja University lai yo stage ma lyai purako ho. Yati ka barsa k herra base ta inharu? Ekkasi sarkar bata niskepachi buddhi aayo? As soon as Congress loses its power, they start acting like they are the real saviors.

Yeah, Rabi has his faults, and I am not his supporter but Gagan Thapa using the same tactics is getting boring now. There was a video of him saying 'Bolna paunu parcha' and now his party is constantly blocking parliament meetings. Rajinama na diye samma aawarodh garne re. Swarnim Wagle ko ni kura ta ramro lagyo. He said even RSP asked resignation of Finance Minster but they allowed him to speak in the parliment. Yata ta Congress bolnei na dine bhanira the asti samma. Also, Congress is the same party that was trying their best to save Bal Krishna Khad who got sacked for his involvement in the Bhutanese Refugee scandal. They even gave him some kind of samman. If we talk about accusations, his party members are accused of so many scandals.

This is just my rant about him. Aba Rabi le chanbin samiti banaunu parcha orcha tyo sab kura haru ko barema pachi bhanumla. Aaile lai chai yei gan gan dekhera risuthyo so post gareko.

Also, we should stop calling him 'Yuwa Neta'.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1cpgyy6/gagan_thapas_political_career_is_just_him/,5/11/2024 12:59,130,0,86,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

1frzanl,"Are Nepali Civil Engineers Incompetent, or Are They Just Victims of Political Corruption?
","I’ve noticed something concerning when it comes to infrastructure in Nepal, specifically bridges. The ones built with foreign aid or by engineers from other countries seem to be standing the test of time—still strong and in good condition. But on the flip side, bridges constructed by Nepali engineers seem to get destroyed by floods and poor maintenance more often than not.

Is this a reflection of the incompetency of our own civil engineers, or are they just ""Jholey"" engineers—politically affiliated, working under pressure from corrupt politicians? It makes me wonder: are our best engineers unable to do their jobs properly because of political interference, lack of resources, or both?

Nepal has the talent, but why are the results so different when it comes to our own projects versus foreign-backed ones?

14gola2,How nepali politics is messed up,"Recently, I went to a restaurant that was empty. After a while I saw a guy rating corn with a bag (jholey) enter.. then a bunch of people entered.. there was one civil security guy with a gun (civil dress ma cop). And then this guy who is mp and member of congress or communist (I forgot) entered and went inside a private room for meeting. 

Then an army of guys came in and were talking about politics and balen. I must say, these guys really hate KTM mayor balen. One of the the men in that meeting is head of student union of some party and they were forming a strategy to bring down balen and most independent candidates. 

During that time, a minister from pradesh 1 or 2 had passed away in a motor vehicle accident. Every one present there didn't give a rats ass. 

After this experience, I have realized that we have become so selfish to a point that it has become toxic. We can't see or want any one to progress. Our values, norms has been replaced with money and power. If this carries on, our culture, country will no longer exist. Nepal and nepali people won't be remembered at all. It's high time politicians do things for the country rather than them selves. 

In regards to balen, i have realized, the guy is super calculative and knows what he is doing. I also have been seeing a lot of anti balen reddit posts where people have been posting videos of street vendors being taken by metro cops. I actually support this movement cuz it minimalizes black money and helps registered business owners to increase their income.

1duhq3g,"Political, Economic and Social Situation of our nation, Nepal","Here for some serious discussion and opinions from valubale people. Dont you guys think Nepal is again going towards darkness or some force is trying to push Nepal towards darkness. Here is my thoughts and happy to hear yours too.

1.) We had expected some kind of stability in government and policies but after the resignation of few ministers today, we are heading to fourth government within 18 months of election.

2.) The finance sector is just fucked up. Looking at the data there is enough liquidity in the banks but loan disbursement is really not upto the mark. And banks say there NPA is below 4% but the inability to disburse loan makes me think that banks NPA is well above 8% to 9% and from the government steps are taken to hide those real data from the public.

3.) More than 34 months of bearish market and people's money are stuck in the market.

4.) Big corruption cases seems to get opened but due to power they get closed asap. Billions of rupees scammed by administration of cooperatives and the builders.

5.) Recent SEE exams results and 52% failed. For a country to not grow, education sector is hampered. Those who failed and will fail the chance exam will not be considered as skilled manpower. Thus, most of the will remain underpriviledged either in Nepal or Arab Nations.

6.) Majority of the high school passout are targeting US, Europe or Australia which is good for them but not the country because billions of untaxed money is being sent abroad which is a big hindrance to our economy. (I am not considering those who are going abroad as bad or negative as everyone has the right to go and search for their better future.)

Harka Sampang recently met both Balen Shah and Swagat Nepal and he made a facebook post which states ""हतार नगर्नु नयाँ शक्ति निर्माण हुनेछ !"" so I guess it wasn't just some random rumour and these three guys are indeed forming together a political party, I'm still unsure about the involvement of Balen Shah though!

1bc70oz,The political course in the next two months [ASSUMPTIONS],"In a programme, the current PM of Nepal, PKD (Prachanda) stated that as long as he's alive, there will be instability. This was said after he broke the 5 party alliance including the largest party Nepali Congress. I guess he himself has given the solution to the major problem in overall growth of our country. Directly or indirectly, this man has affected the political scenario for almost three decades and shows no sign of stopping.

Nepali Congress is now weighed down by their own number of seats in the parliament. Despite being the largest party now has to remain in opposition. Three parties, surprisingly including the United Socialists (एस) led by MKN, have left NC alone. This was totally unforeseen. NC's recent committee convention must have been a precursor to this breakage of coalition. However, NC will find a way to be in the government. Remember how they gave the vote of confidence to PKD when PKD was with the UML alliance? 

Thus, this Prachanda characteristic is cancerous. This is a disease that has to be cured. 

Now the political course of the next two months (my assumptions). 

- PKD as PM of new coalition has to get votes of confidence and will get them from the current alliance. NC, RPP, Janamat and other fringe parties wouldn't. 

- Current alliance is for Prachanda to continue being in power as in the former alliance he had to handover to MKN in a year. 

- No power handover is discussed between OLI and PKD so PKD could be the first PM of Nepal to serve full term. However, the following point can spoil the fun for PKD. 

- In a recent speech by Ramesh Lekhak in the Parliament he questioned what would happen if those who were betrayed by the same entity come together? 

- UML being the second largest party and the largest party in current government, astonishingly has gotten not-so-strong portfolios for their ministers. I guess this coalition is just passing time to see if any offer comes from NC in the meantime. 

- RSP getting along with the communists and not with the ones their ideologies match, that is the NC, baffles me. Well they have good ministries in their pockets. I hope they set an example. 

- RPP is running nationwide protests against the current form of government and demands the reinstatement of Monarchy and Hindu Nation. 

In conclusion, what I assume is, NC will propose UML to lead the government and they will run the country together(two betrayed come together). If this doesn't happen, the protests from RPP would gather more support and maybe, we could see the downfall of Republic Nepal.

2. Foreign aid is not provided by the ""goodness"" in the heart of foreign leaders, they are provided as a conditional incentives to push the policies of a nation into a desirable political state. 

Money that can be used to develop ones economy, streghthen ones military, provide better lives for it's citizens, win more votes will never be provided unconditionally to another nation whose citizens don't vote in your elections. Those you believe so are naive

3. The larger the foreign aid package, the more a receiving nation will have to sacrifice in policies. 

If a policy was popular a ruling government will enact it to win more votes and stay in power. As such, the foreign aid has to be large enough to benifit them more than the votes they will lose because of the enactment of policies that they are forced to enact in exchange for the aid. 

Now to the MCC, I will not provide an introduction as everyone here probably knows what it is. 

If you agree with the axioms provided above you will think that MCC is terrible for us because it will ultimately lead to the United States forcing policies to Nepali politicians that will be unpopular among the Nepali people (for their good or their worse, only time will tell). 

However, there is a catch. These axioms are based on a political perspective, not civil. From a civilian's stand point, we have to measure the value of the infrastructure that the MCC will provide and weigh it against the policies the United States will inflict in return. 

Yes, our politicians will get their cut. Directly-Indirectly. It doesn't matter, they will have their cut. But from what is left, will it be enough to out weigh the negative impact it might have on our country. 

There are a lot of examples of foreign aid from the United States ending in good ways and bad ways, for example South Korea and Japan or examples of United States foreign aid, both providing money for development and pushing for more democratic societies. Another example would be Iraq, where all the money that was provided went straight into the pockets of the corrupt government and left the citizens with policies worse than if nothing was done. We have to decide which side of the coin we will fall in. 

End note: I believe that the core mistake a lot of people here make is to believe that our politicians are stupid. That these people, the most powerful and richest in the entire nation are idiots who don't know how to run a country. 

That is not true, they are rational actors. 

They know how to run a country. Only difference being you think how to run a country is to maximize prosperity for its citizens, they think that the best way to run a country is to maximize prosperity for them and stay in power as long as possible.

Desh ko fast track nabaney ni bhrastachari ko lai fast track khuleko cha. Sumana Shrestha and other have raised their concern against this. Please watch the vid/ reel on it. 

2) Political leaders in Podcasts.  
 \- Its undeniable that the popularity of podcasts/ YT in Nepal is growing. Should interviewer/podcasters be held liable more on asking the tough and important questions rather than just generic conversation where the leaders are praising loktantra. 

Recently, Mr. Oli appeared in Its my show by Suraj Singh Thakuri and PM Mr. Dahal appeared in Sanjay Silwal's podcast/interview. May be they had some sort of pressure on them but both of those interviews were below average and ineffective essentially. 

When important people of the country as such appear for interview, people need to realize and ask some relatable questions rather than just entertain them .""Khoi ta hajur le vaneko kura pura vako?"" ""K kura le badhaa pugeko cha?""

&#x200B;

Interestingly enough on silwal's interview at 19:20 min, Mr. Dahal talks about Loktantra and how loktanttra ko baikalpa vaneko better loktanttra ho re. He also talks about how loktantra is all about janta ko sasaaan - but its interesting how currently we have a system where the sasaan is of leaders of few parties. Direct elect prime minister ko questions uthayedeko vae huni. 

The interview also highly revolves around ""Yuva"" (youth) but khai ta yuva lai leadership role ma aauna deko. 

&#x200B;

Both interviews have 100k+ views as of now and I just think such high profile interviewers should not entertain these leaders by providing the platform where they basically are doing ""ma-paai"". 

&#x200B;

3) If anyone is closely within the reach of Suraj g and Sanjay g, please share this. When such political leaders come in, there should be one most important component: Fact Check. Its okay, if you don't have resources to do so during the interview but hajur haru ko reach thulo cha - an idea could be to do a follow up show where you dissect the things that the guests said. Aru ko important chaina but these important leaders ko chai must ho. 

&#x200B;

4) It would be nice if the interviewers could give some heads up before inviting guests so that common yuvas like us can put in questions in comment sections.

nksxdz,People who say KP Oli is the best out of the worst have no political conscience,"""KP Oli is the better out of the worst"" can someone who believe in this give me good reasons for this? 
I say he's the worst out there. He thinks he's above the constitution, in a way he has hijacked major entities of government. He has no love for the democracy. Tell me where was KP Oli when people were dying in the roads fighting against the king. He was not involved in Jana Aandolan, he used to say ""Nepal ma ganatantra aaunu vaneko byal gada chadera America gaye jasto ho"". 
He's a master manipulator, protector of gundas. Look at his history and his past statements. 
He's egoistic, narcissistic and delusional old man. 
For him, only his hanuman are Nepali citizen, others are just birodhis. 

He understands Nepali sentiment very well, he played the anti India card to win the past election. He even said he didn't know India was making road in Lipulekh few weeks before publishing the map. He didn't publish the map out of his own will but because of public pressure and support from all political parties. 

He protects corrupted leaders who are in his side. He rewards lobbyists who are close to him. He looks at his hanuman, and see that they have made a tremendous achievement with wealth by abusing the power and thinks he has made Nepali people rich. 

If you say this is all because of the people around him. No, he made those people like how are they. He nourished them and made them like himself. 

He's not the best out of the worst, he's the worst. 
I know that people don't like Prachanda here on this sub. For me there are better leaders than Prachanda but if I have to choose between Prachanda and KP Oli, I would choose Prachanda. 
I am comparing to Prachanda to tell how bad Oli is.

What happens if no political party forms a majority even in coalition?

Everyone seems to be adamant on electing a president from their party. Perhaps to easily pass bills?

From one of the articles: 

 ***तर, केहीले भने अब मुलुक संविधानको धारा ७६ को उपधारा ३ मा प्रवेश गर्ने तर्क गरेका छन् । उपधारा २ बमोजिम कसैले पनि बहुमतसहितको दाबी गर्न नसकेको अवस्थामा राष्ट्रपतिले धारा ७६ को उपधारा ३ बमोजिम प्रतिनिधिसभाको सबैभन्दा ठुलो दलको हैसियतमा कांग्रेस संसदीय दलका नेतालाई मन्त्रिपरिषद् गठनका लागि आह्वान गर्ने सम्भावना रहेको स्रोत बताउँछ ।***

***यो अवस्थामा पनि एमालेकै भूमिका निर्णायक हुन सक्छ । एमालेले कांग्रेस नेतृत्वको सरकारलाई समर्थन जनाएको खण्डमा कम्तीमा आगामी २ वर्ष यो सरकार रहन्छ । अन्यथा, उपधारा ३ बमोजिमको प्रधानमन्त्रीले ३० दिनभित्र विश्वासको मत लिन नसकेको अवस्थामा धारा ७६ को उपधारा ५ बमोजिम प्रधानमन्त्री नियुक्त हुन सक्छ । त्यस्तो प्रधानमन्त्रीले नै प्रतिनिधिसभा विघटन गरी ताजा जनादेशमा जान सक्ने अधिकार राख्छ ।***

I have been trying to start a political party for the last 5 years, and have worked on some new ideas and philosophies for the current time, people, and situation of our country. Had been researching and meeting people all over the country so that I can better understand the problem for the solution.

3 years ago I started with social media presence and had been trying to go into mass, we started with an offline journey we got a good response, with over 98% of first-person retention.

Currently, I have started uploading videos to youtube again, I have uploaded the first video with my face in it with lots of imperfections. If You watch the video, please dont critisize me and it would be your greatness if you forgive me for any of my mistakes. I am just starting with it and had been trying to do all what it take for the change.

Dear friends of Reddit I have faith and believe in you, Please give me some suggestions, advice, and ideas for the next videos and social media content so that we could get to the mass quickly. 

You know the political system of Nepal, Its tough to fight with system for a common man. Your suggestions, ideas and advice will give me the guts to move forward for a change which we all deserve.

ojdc74,Crash course on Nepali politics?,"Hello r/Nepal!

I'm a Nepali teenager who has lived his entire life abroad and has recently returned. Regrettably, I have not paid much attention to Nepali politics in the past and I am currently trying to change that. I hope you can forgive my ignorance if there's anything I am mistaken about.

With the recent Supreme Court decision to make Sher Bahadur Deuba the Prime Minister, I was wondering about his political history. While I was able to follow KP Oli's recent political career (dissolving the parliament, anti-India sentiments, changing the national map, undermining COVID-19, etc), I can't find much online about Deuba's political agenda/ambitions.

Every source I find online seems to mention the dates and the number of votes he got to be elected, but there's hardly anything about his campaigns, ideology, or political focus. Does anyone know where I could get a crash course/find this information? Or, since he has been the Prime Minister four times, could someone that has observed his previous terms kindly fill me in on what actions he has taken or what he is known for?

1g43whe,Curious about the Lifestyle and Challenges of Being Wealthy in Nepal (And What Really Happens Behind the Scenes),"Hey everyone,

I'm writing this post not to flex, but out of genuine curiosity. I come from a wealthy family in Nepal. We're pretty well-connected in both the political and business scenes, and my family owns several businesses, ranging from construction to hospitality. I’ve been working under my dad in our family's company for a while, learning the ropes and trying to understand the bigger picture.

But I also wanted to share a side of this that not many people talk about. Growing up in this environment wasn’t as glamorous as it might seem. To be honest, I’ve always felt like a neglected child. My family has always been focused on business and maintaining our reputation, and that left little room for emotional connection. I’ve grown up surrounded by wealth and privilege, but it’s been hard to form any real bond with my family members. I was expected to follow in their footsteps, but never really had a voice or say in what I wanted to do with my life.

I’ve recently started noticing a lot of things that don’t sit right with me. I won’t get into too many details right now, but let’s just say there’s more happening behind the scenes in this world of wealth and power existing in Nepal and internationally than most people know. The connections and deals aren’t as clean as they’re made out to be, and there’s a lot of manipulation involved. It’s not all success and hard work—there’s a darker side to how things operate in business and politics here.

I plan to slowly expose more of what I've learned about these systems and the schemes behind it all. This isn’t something I’ve talked about openly before, but I’m realizing it’s time to confront the reality of how things work in Nepal’s elite circles.

Feel free to ask me anything—about the lifestyle, the business world, or even how these political connections really play out. I’m happy to share more as I start piecing everything together.

117xbl9,Does Dhurmus-Suntali have political protection ? Is this the reason they are not prosecuted.,"In reference to this interview of Renu Dahal.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T3K9TDfeT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T3K9TDfeT8)

it seems, the stadium project isn't taken over and construction hasn't resumed because Dhurmus-Suntali took 18corod loan and cannot resume without clearing loan.

However, agreement between Dhurmus-suntali and bharatpur metro state that it shouldn't be debt financed. The loan is taken by dhurmus-suntali, liability is of dhurmus-suntali not Dhurmu-suntali.

The main question is how come they secured 18cr loan? and from whom? to obtain 18 cr loan, they have to show asset/property of atleast 18cr (this being liberal) and show income of at least 2-3cr per year.

Also, routine was supporting them and posting positive only news of them during campaign period. Was routine paid of that ? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/117xbl9/does_dhurmussuntali_have_political_protection_is/,2/21/2023 7:15,8,0,7,English,1,1,0,0,0,2

w6g29d,About the new political candidate making the rounds: Arnico Panday,"It seems like he's running for parliament from Lalitpur-3 as an independent candidate. I saw a bunch of posts on social media from Nepali celebrities and *Routine of Nepal Banda* about why we ought to vote for him, and I'm rather perplexed at the situation. It seems like his supporters have only three talking points about why he should be elected, and I'll list them here:

1. He's got degrees from Harvard and MIT
2. He's unhappy with the current situation, which is why he moved back to Nepal
3. He is extremely humble.

If you read the points closely, you'll notice that there's something very important missing: policies. I haven't come across a single policy that isn't a vague insinuation that doesn't actually say anything.

Regarding his degrees and his expertise, I don't discredit that. He is an actual expert in the field of climate science and has written numerous papers on far-reaching subjects. I would actually appreciate more technically adept people being in charge of steering the ship of state.

His technical know-how, impressive though it may be, doesn't particularly translate into good political nous. His website gives you a floating election poster where he talks about why he's running and gives you hazy points about making the situation better without actually saying how. I'm particularly irked by how people keep promoting the idea that he should get the vote because despite where he got his education from (which he mentions in all caps every single time) he is incredibly humble. His retweets of those kind of posts give credence to the notion that this is the narrative that he's trying to create. The oxymoronic combination of promoting his humility while bragging about the universities he's been to just makes him look rather moronic. Policies and ideas work on their own merit and not by the virtue of who made them. Similarly, politicians prove their mettle by how well they can get their intended policies supported by their electorate, not by listing your alma maters as your political credentials.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/w6g29d/about_the_new_political_candidate_making_the/,7/23/2022 22:31,12,0,13,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

""I'm a surgeon""

or

""I'm a stay at home wife.""

while the inferior of the two will say,

""I'm “hindu” “shiv bhakt""  

or

""I'm a liberal""

or

""I'm a vegan.""

The reason why one is superior to the other is that in order to be a ""plumber"" or a ""surgeon"" or a ""stay at home mother"" means you must do something or achieve something.  Being “hindu"" or declaring yourself a ""vegan"" simply takes a declaration and nothing more.  And though it may seem to be a very subtle difference, it is something I immediately pick up on when meeting people for the first time.  For nearly 100% of the time when somebody defines themselves by their belief system or ideology and NOT their profession that person proves to be somebody I not only dislike, but do not trust. 

The reason why is that when somebody substitutes a belief, religion or an ideology for achievement, it is an (admittedly) unconscious admission of laziness and proof of a weak, or total absence of, character.  A person who defines themselves by merely joining a group or espousing beliefs lacks the rigor, determination, work effort and temerity to do something productive and meaningful in their lives.  However, their ego is such that it cannot stand having no prestige or respect and thus they join a ""club.""  Ergo why I truly believe the VAST majority of religious participants do not participate in religion for something as noble as god, as much as it is first and foremost for themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/yqd9ay/not_to_ridicule_any_religion_caste_political/,11/9/2022 9:02,0,0,7,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

knm2uv,Just wondering on people views on sajha bibeksheel party or the concept of alternative political parties,"This sub isnt the accurate representation of generic population of nepal but still The general environment in nepal suggest great dissatisfaction against current political parties. For me the main problem is incompetence. But in general for most people it seems corruption ( meaning all this related to abusing power, forming syndicates, etc..) i am quite young and i have not voted yet. next election quite possibly, would be my first. Recently i have been informing myself on nepal's politics heavily. And i have to say i have very negative impression towards political environment of nepal. And i see two political parties with somewhat considerable public support to call themself the alternative power. I dont see much new with the new janata samajwad party even the faces are old. Sajha bibeksheel party i can see some differences.


They are not great. I dont see fundamental changes to current political parties.In terms of competence. I dont see much. My views coincidenced with surya raj acharya but he is nomore a party member. I liked his take on making the party somewhat technocratic. They dont have much to show. they say they have good footprint on social media i dont see much either. Except handing quite some traffic on twitter handles of some members of the party. Etc etc.. i will give them some benifit of the doubt considering they are quite small with not much funding. And they are nepali political parties, cant expect much.


But for nepali people the elephant in the room ""the corruption problem"". I think they are quite attractable to me atleast. They preach about them having higher morals though thats not a good sales pitch. But they do have some practical things to show for. Like how they try to be transparent. By making financials public. And i resonate with views on the degradation thats in political culture of nepal. My question is if nepalese are that dissatisfied with current political parties which has consistently shown their true colors . Why not give these new parties some chance, some power even if just to disrupt the syndicates in the political circle! How bad can it be?

l37q72,KP Oli is probably a political genius,"I never like this man. Only went to youtube and search for him for laugh and memes. But it seems he is a political genius who turns any situation in his favor.

Out of nowhere, he became a force to be reckoned with after 2015. He used anti-India sentiments in his favor. He used party merger as a tool to win election. Other opponents (esp. Nepali Congress) didn't even have any plan what they will do if they win the election, Sher Bahadur as PM? some Poudel guy as PM? But unified NCP promised a stable government and KP Oli as PM. I believe this clarity greatly helped him achieve a 2/3 majority.

The thing didn't work out. Oli dissolved the parliament. There is Oli and there is Prachanda, MaKuNe, Jhallnath, etc, basically 1vs3. Was Oli right? or was Prachanda right? These three guys say something in RatnaPark; Oli put some jokes and ukhhan during the press conference, their whole argument is destroyed. Brings ZeeNews does interview in Hindi and becomes a hero - some still take it as a popularity stunt; while some praise him.

Then these three guys try some shakti pradashan and bring the whole village to Kathmandu. Oli does nothing, and the sentiment of general people are now suddenly negative towards these three. These three got more hate from the general public than Oli after dissolving parliament.

xd35tv,Ace your election! With the strategic political campaign victory will chose you.,"let this post be approved I am very much aware of the policies of this community. I desire to guide the people who are preparing for political campaign. I have not mentioned any political parties name or their candidate, But few example explained in informal and non-offensive language. 

 While the give political situation is an important factor, in many cases the most important factor- the difference between winning and losing - is what goes on inside the campaign.  The winning political campaign is most often the one that takes the time to target voters, develops a convincing message and follows through on a reasonable plan to contact those voters. 

I have superficially interpreted lots of thing from the strategy that I have prepare. In informal language in a way that even monkey will understand. 

This is just an example that most candidates are not familiar with at all.

Example: 1

 Let us say that your district has a population of 130,000 people. Of this population, there are 30,000 children below voting age and other non-registered voters, leaving a total number of 100,000 voters. In the past election, there was 50% turnout of voters, or 50,000 votes cast. You assume it will be the same this time. The winning candidate received 34% of the vote or 17,000 votes cast. If you figure an average of two voters per household, this would come to 8,500 households.  

Now, you cannot assume that every voter you talk with will be persuaded to vote for you. So you  should figure to communicating with a larger number of voters in order to receive the votes from  17,000 voters or 8,500 households. Suppose you persuade seven out of every 10 voters you  communicate with to vote for you. You will need to talk to 25,000 voters or 13,000 households in order to be assured of support from 17,000 voters or 8,500 households (25,000 x 0.7 = 17,500 and  13,000 x 0.7 = 9,100).

  It is still a lot easier to talk with and try to persuade 13,000 families than it is to talk to and try and  persuade 100,000 people. This whole process is narrowing the group of people you need to  persuade down to a much smaller size. 

Example: 2

Tyo voters harulaipani  demographic group ma  division garne for example women, religion, old age, farmer, business person, student aadi ma divide garne ani women lai unko rights ko kura garne, religion lai culture promote ( financial tatha media ko suppport bata ) , students lai job opportunity, college  scholarship, quota etc  old age lai pension, farmer ko lagi agriculture lai level up garne yesto campaign chalaunu parxa

kinavane old age harulai women rights , college ko bare k matlab what they want is pension tesai gari student lai pension ko k matlab. yesari group banaune uniharu ko issues ko discuss garnu parxa. But what politician does is corruption, inflation, nationality  ko kura garxa old age, student, women farmer ko agadi which is ineffective. I know corruption, inflation voters ko lagi important xa tara indirectly matra we should not forget that human nature I mean uniharulai directly related hune kura garyo vane ajhai trust badxa. 

Example: 3

 there are three types of voters: your supporters, your opponents' supporters and those voters in the middle who have yet to make up their minds. Your supporters are those who have already decided to vote for you. Your opponents' supporters are those who have already decided to vote for your opponents. You should target the undecided.

politician harule money kasare waste garxa? campaign organize garxa aafnai supporter haru ko lagi jasle pailai nai uniharulai vote dine decide garisakeka hunxa. senseless guff hanera self-bejjat garyo events ko resources waste. And then they complain that it is hard to win the election even after spending huge amount of resources. 

Most people think that money will make them win election not at all bro. K garne paisa le? sab lai paisa diyera vote magne? Know about the voters kati paisa dinxau? they are not just selling their vote but also kind of selling their soul, will money solve their issues?  you think money can buy people soul? hola koi monkey haru but it will not be sufficient to win election with money only.

 However you can win election with affordable budget through this strategy if you don't have negative backgroud. the 6 step strategy to win the election is; first ma research garyo aawasyak data ko lagi, second ma kati voter xan, kati vote chaixa, tyo vote lina kati ghar janu parxa determine garyo, third ma voters lai group ma division garera target garyo, demographic ra geographic basis ma garna sakinxa , Fourth ma tyo group ko lagi message develop garyo , group ko issue lai related, Fifth ma group snga contact kasari garne? bulk sms (tyo institue bata sab customer ko phone ma message garne tarika) door to door, media, resources utilize garne principle, targeted group convince garne , Six step aba volunteer, candidate, campaign manager ko roles etc. 

In the strategy I have used formal Nepali laguage. I have prepare this for the candidate that I want him to win. it has been really effective we have targeted a religious group they are convinced. We promise them to promote their culture  by giving financial sup and media. Their vote was really imp for us to win. Similarly, we have targeted finance groups and old aged because the old aged voters are more in this districts.

 If anyone is supporting for the candidate in upcoming election and preparing for campaign you must have a idea of this strategy otherwise you will be using your resources ineffectively that might not even lead you to win. It is also possible that you have better strategy than this but this can also be helpful. here is the content of the strategy but for the document you will have to pay. It will be helpful for election whether for mayor or Mps.  Since most candidate fight with no strategic plan if you have a strategy you have the upper hand.

zrpe8c,what's your view on people holding prominent positions within a political party and also in government?,"Nepali Political Parties should understand that the Party and Government should be kept segregated. People holding prominent positions in the party should focus on improving their base and discipline the members. People to run the government should be primarily focused on government. 

But in Nepal, Individual make their fraction base strong  and then go on to hold the party chief position after that to PM. Due to this there is no discipline inside the party, lots of fractions within the party and if the party is no mature enough then the fractions gets separated as new party.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/zrpe8c/whats_your_view_on_people_holding_prominent/,12/21/2022 15:00,3,0,0,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

And the party jholeys and people who were against balen and who were waiting for this exact moment made a stunt by donating money. Harkey decided to give his one month salary to pacify his long lived frustration against balen. 

Let's say they give her money and it helps her for sometime then what after that? Did they solve her living condition or her poverty? And there are thousands of street vendors like her.

1e34kvg,Manish Jha Trades Data from Facts Nepal for Election Ticket: A Story of Opportunism and Corruption,"Manish Jha has been an active and prominent associate with the Nepali Congress for a considerable period. However, prior to the last elections, he felt that his prospects for rapid advancement within the Nepali Congress, such as securing a position as a parliamentarian or a minister, were limited. Observing potential opportunities in the Rashtriya Sutantra Party, he contemplated a switch. His transition to the Rashtriya Sutantra Party is an intriguing story.

Several of his colleagues from the Nepali Congress had already joined the Rashtriya Sutantra Party and were engaged from its inception. While these colleagues had officially entered the Rashtriya Sutantra Party, Manish Jha remained with the Nepali Congress. As the election neared, he became increasingly opportunistic and sought to join the Rashtriya Sutantra Party, albeit belatedly.

Manish Jha managed to secure a professional representative ticket from the Rashtriya Sutantra Party through a strategic maneuver. He had been working at FactNepal, a company specializing in data analytics, data visualizations, and data consulting. Recognizing the value of his expertise, he contacted his former colleagues, who were now poised to receive tickets as parliamentary representatives from the Rashtriya Sutantra Party. 

In the lead-up to the elections, Manish Jha proposed a deal. He offered to provide valuable data, information, and support for their election campaign in exchange for lobbying with Ravi Lamechhane, the party chairperson, to secure a ticket for himself. The Rashtriya Sutantra Party, in need of campaign information such as local phone contacts and insights into voter behavior and sentiments, accepted his offer. Manish Jha provided extensive data, including phone numbers, contact details, and information on voters' relations, to aid the party's election campaign team.

Through this exchange, Manish Jha secured an election seat. Despite presenting a commendable public image, his actions reveal a darker side. His indirect and strategic maneuvers have consistently demonstrated a willingness to exploit systems for personal gain, casting a shadow over his public persona.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1e34kvg/manish_jha_trades_data_from_facts_nepal_for/,7/14/2024 15:09,1,0,4,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

In my opinion, Ravi should not run for the re-election ( Or at least only after all allegations and charges are cleared) as he could possibly be jailed anytime after. Sure, he can get his citizenship on Sunday and become the president of his party again but contesting for Member of Parliament doesn't seem like a good idea, ethically speaking.

""There might not be a greater sin than to be poor in this country. Why were these street vendors trying to set up shop after 7 PM on the edge of the emptying road in Sundhara, subjected to such sudden brutality while trying to save their goods? Six street vendors have been admitted to Bir Hospital, with head injuries and fractures. How will they sustain their families in the months to come?

The Metropolitan City Police has no right to use batons or torture civilians. It has no constitutional basis to seize personal property either. This is a crime. Human Rights Organizations, Civil society, Influencers, parties, the Federal Government, and more: Will they all stay silent until the day a privileged person is affected by this brutality?

After the September Agreement with Kathmandu Metropolitan City to implement Mayor Balen's own election promises regarding street vendors had been allowed to ply their trades before 8 AM and after 7 PM(low traffic hours) in many parts of the city. Mobile vendors were granted relative liberty in inner roads. We have received assurances that there would be no violence against vendors anymore. However, in the past couple of months or so, there has been no follow up on the agreement and the violence against the street vendors has intensified.""

nibmu9,LETS RUN ON THE NEXT ELECTION /अब हुने चुनाबमा हामि आफै उम्मेद्वर हुन सकिदैन ?,"LETS RUN ON THE NEXT ELECTION - LOOKING FOR LIKE MINDED PEOPLE.

Whenever the next election may be - we will still need to vote someone out of major party so thats not good .I don't blame all the politicians - not all politicians of major party are bad but they are not doing good work because of party politics or may be they are not capable in management because at the end handling ministries or offices is all about result driven management which they might not be capable of OR they get entangled into the net of  big ""DALALs"" / businessmen or whoever is running things from the behind.... and once they get entangled into the web...they cant get out.

Anyways, my thought is how diffcult is it to run and win **federal election** or **provincial election** as an individual OR my actual thinking is as a group of individual (not a party). Group of like minded individual because if we can come up with an election plan ... same can be replicated in all ""nirwachan chetra"" - निर्वाचन क्ष्हेत्र - election constituencies.

Let me get into specific example .[http://www.election.gov.np/ecn/uploads/userfiles/maps/KATHMANDU.pdf](http://www.election.gov.np/ecn/uploads/userfiles/maps/KATHMANDU.pdf)

This is the election area map of Kathmandu which in federal level has **10 election constituencies** divided by red lines. And then within each **ferderal election constituencies** the area enclosed by red line - it is further divided by blue line .... those are the **provincial election constituencies.**

So all in all there are 10 at proviincial level and 20 at provincial level.For reference please start with Koteshwor area on the border of Bhaktapur and Lalitpur (ward 32) - it runs upto Shankharapur Nagarpalika. This is **ferderal election constituency no. 2** This **ferderal election constituency no. 2** has been further divided into **provincial election constituencies 2(1) and 2(2)** which is seperated by blue line.This is one of the biggest areas... othes are quite small/ dense.

So is it not possible to run for election on these areas ? There are areas smaller than this as well.

Additionally please see :[https://election.ekantipur.com/pradesh-3/district-kathmandu?lng=eng](https://election.ekantipur.com/pradesh-3/district-kathmandu?lng=eng)

This is the result of last election . Please use the filter option on that page to see the provincial elections as well.

**Federal election constituency no. 2Total Votes Cast :** **50 Thousand approxWinning Vote : 27 Thousand approx**

**Provincial election constituency no. 2 (1)Total Votes Cast :** **15 Thousand approxWinning Vote : 9 Thousand approx**

Again - this is one of the bigger constituencies ... on other constituencise of KTM - the winning votes are approx **11 Thousand / 13 Thousand for Federal.**

So wihtout stretching this further what I am saying is .

We need to come up with actual vision to take to people - actionable / grounded plans that we can actually deliver for the betterment of the region and country. Then we need to come up with election plan - we donot have to go door to door asking for votes - we can use digitial marketing techniques or my thinking is if we are really genuine and really have good vision we can convince people to give us vote instead of same old politicians . I think the era of JHOLY karyakarta and gullible people voting for same person each election is gone. People are more aware and more involved in social and political areas now a days. They form their own opinion and even deep down everyone at this moment wants good people to elected for the country .. for their children... setting aside their political affiliation.

So .. are there people who think like me and think this can be achieved . I am not only looking to actively run for election... if someone else is interested I can support as well.. but its not a one man job... we need to have a small group of like minded people ... who are already doing something of their own, are financially stable enough to venture into this OR we can have someone who genuinely wants to be a good politician or career politician .",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/nibmu9/lets_run_on_the_next_election_अब_हन_चनबम_हम_आफ/,5/22/2021 5:32,27,0,20,English,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lets say candidate A had won the previous election. So he is #1 seed candidate in this election. Candidate B is #2 seed but he is meh ( not that special/good) and candidate C who is #3 but people believe that he is very good and deserving.

Most people believe candidate A is bad so majority voters don't want him to win. But they also think he will get significant amount of votes cause some people will still stay loyal to his party. 

Majority people dont want to vote candidate A and want to vote candidate C. If all the people who share that opinion all vote for C then C will win easily and A will lose.

But the C supporters will think that most who dont like A will vote B. So voting C will only help A win. Thus, they think that in order for A to lose they should vote B. In the end B gets elected.

This is similar to the game theory: Prisoner's dilemma.

z2mdgh,Two inspiring stories of this year's election.,"It's so common in our country masu bhaat raksi khane vote garne and This open secret has been known by the authority, election Commission but they have simply done nothing against it. So gullible people harule vote dinxan in name of masu bhaat. While there are other kind of people jasle sab party ko khanxan and give vote afnu anusaar. Hamro desh ma majority vane kai yestai duita group ko xa and finding the other categories than this is quite difficult. And in this election I got to personally know two such people so sharing their stories here. 

The 1st story is of an old woman who lives in my neighbouring locality. I used to believe most of jholeys people of the parties are primarily old and Illiterate people because they are easy to brainwash. But this old lady of the locality completely changed my perspective. So what happened was that election vanda ak din pahila one of the candidate's right hand person was giving 2 thousands rupees each to every old lady and asking to vote for his party. This person went to her and gave her  money. But she not only did not take that but also scolded him and made other old women return the money as well. And she didn't stop there. She called the police and reported all this. Police aune jel they were gone and police le testo dherai kehi garya hola wa kehi rok tham garekohola vayena lagdaina but what an illiterate old woman did was so brave and so inspiring. So i am sharing her story here. 

The 2nd story is of a police lady who was at the election booth. So i went to cast the vote around 1 pm there I found 3 police personnel there. There was also a party volunteer who was giving water bottles to everyone because it was a sunny day and he was trying to persuade people to vote for his party. I just happened to be there when the party worker gave water bottles to the police guys and the two of them drank that water and passed it to the lady police but she denied it. The other police guy asked "" mam pani na khane? "" She said nai hunxa sir lai yo pani pardaina tapai haru khane vaye khanu"". Again he asked kina k vayo raw? she just  said yestai sir mero aatma le dinna. She took out rs 50 and bought two bottles of water. This may not be a big thing tara i was really moved by this because it was such a small thing that too they were giving to everyone. That lady le lida kehi thula wrong pani hudaina thiyo but she was so brutally honest.

There was also a similar trend in the general election and local elections of 2017- about 270k eligible voters were there from Kathmandu. However, there were more than 6 lakhs eligible voters from the district for the general election in 2017.

I woke up, went for inspection with my mother, brother and two neighbors. It was found that they broke into our neighbour's shop, which was in our house.  
According to my mom, she heard the shutter going up, woke up and realized that it was from our house. She then shoutedand called the police. After that, two guys, (estimated age: 20-25) started running from there. After that police arrived. Upon inspection, we found that shutter was lifted about 2 feet, every drawers were opened and a wallet was taken.   
So, in this election period, when most of the people have gone to their hometown for casting vote, crime rate is increasing unusually.

1avdynl,Covid vaccine linked to small increase in heart and brain condition!,"To many people were shouting this in my circle for a long time! Now it is confirmed! 


The largest COVID vaccine study to date has identified some risks associated with the shot.

Researchers from the Global Vaccine Data Network (GVDN) in New Zealand analyzed 99 million people who received COVID vaccinations across eight countries.

People who received certain types of mRNA vaccines were found to have a higher risk of myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle.

Other potential risks included inflammation of part of the spinal cord after viral vector vaccines, and inflammation and swelling in the brain and spinal cord after viral vector and mRNA vaccines, the press release stated.

The university of New Auckland giving a general description of the study!

https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2024/02/19/99million-people-in-largest-global-vaccine-study.html

The findings come from the largest-ever COVID vaccine study, which analyzed 99 million cases of vaccination. 

Professor of Medicine, Dr. Marc Siegel:

""The massive study and review of the data reveals some rare association of the MRNA vaccines and myocarditis, especially after the second shot, as well as an association between the Oxford Astra Zeneca adenovirus vector vaccines and Guillain Barre syndrome.""

nsld4k,My Covid experience,"Like many, I thought this Corona will not affect me as nothing happened to me and my family last year. 

I was surprised when my elder brother, who lives in the same household, mentioned that he tested positive while visiting a hospital for his frequent urinary problem. My wife went to get her pcr testing the same day and was tested negative. The next day our in-laws called my wife and our nine months old child to live with them. 

At home, my brother, thanks to his stubborn wife, didn't take self-isolation very seriously. It was due to the second pcr testing done at Metro Hospital which came negative and that threw the curve ball. My brother was in a room adjacent to mine on the same floor and was using the same bathroom. I wore mask and was careful. However,  about three weeks ago, I felt sick. I had no heart for food, mild headache, and fatigue. I knew something was wrong. I didn't go to hospital or pcr testing for three days. But when I talked to my wife and sister, they insisted I get tested for Covid.

Subsequently, I went for testing at Teku hospital because I had no trust in a private hospital pcr testing. The report came positive. By that time I was having a mild breathing difficulty. When my oxygen level was measured, it was in low 80s. My wife and family insisted that i seek medical help immediately. My bother was already admitted due to Covid complications and his whole family was tested positive including the kids. 

Getting a hospital bed with oxygen was really difficult.  I didn't know it at the time but my wife called many places. Fortunately, a hospital in Thimi had a bed with oxygen and I was admitted there. An xray scan revealed that I had infection in my lungs. They started with Remdicivir antibiotics. I was in 1 liter oxygen. 

The hospital was crowded with Covid patients and no facilities for food for the patients. One person had to be standby for medicine and meals. Consequently, I was transferred to Kantipur hospital in New Baneshwor because it would be convenient. One day hospital bed  charge was 20 thousand rupees, plus extra for any medicine. However,  the hospital was a complete mess. Loud noise over the speaker that was fitted in the room, hindi songs in the evening and bhajans in the morning. I was miserable. I was just wishing for some rest in quietness. I had to get out of there. 

By that time, there was a bed at Medicity hospital and I was taken there. I started feeling better as the last dose of the antibiotics was administered. Although I still tested positive,  the hospital recommended that I can self isolate at home. And that's where I am right now. It's been about a week in isolation and I am taking it seriously. 

The main issues I am having at the moment is insomnia at night and piles.

I think this Covid is serious as I have seen things from inside the hospitals. 

Everyone please take it seriously. Fortunately for me I am back home, but many are not so lucky. 

Observe the safety procedures, wear mask and all.

1e95elv,We Nepalese Lack Civic Sense,"I was traveling on a bus, and there was a couple in front of me (husband, wife, and an 8-10-year-old child). The child was eating cheese balls. After he finished, he was holding the empty wrapper in his hands. Suddenly, his mom snatched the wrapper from his hand and threw it out of the bus window. The child said, ""Miss le vannuvako bato ma fohor falnu hudaina"" (The teacher said we shouldn't throw trash on the road), but his mom silenced him.

This seems like a small incident, but it has a bigger impact on children's psychology and I have seen numerous cases where people are not accountable. We only blame politicians and our leaders, but do we think about whether we are doing enough as members of society, as citizens? 

Just think about it: When was the last time you did something good for your society that actually benefited others? Most of us are busy with our own lives.

10ap5ov,"Covid , Vaccines and Heart problems"," 

Covid , a cardio vascular disease can cause heart conditions in some people  
and the same is with its vaccines to  
but multiple research have shown the conditions are worse in unvaccinated than in vaccinated  
[https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2022/12/05/19/58/prognosis-of-myocarditis-developing](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2022/12/05/19/58/prognosis-of-myocarditis-developing)

For example  the above mentioned research shows  
**Mortality of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-related myocarditis is significantly lower than viral infection–related myocarditis.**  
You can go to the link and read about the methodology there

I am not denying that the vaccine doesn't cause some heart conditions but these conditions are very less dangerous compared to the alternative that is being vaccinated .

[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7114e1.htm](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/heart-problems-much-more-likely-covid-infection-vaccine)

[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.951314/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.951314/full)

The first one is the compilation of data of 40 health care systems  
and second one is meta analysis 22 eligible studies consisting of 55.5 million vaccinated cohorts and 2.5 million in the infection cohort.

The benefits of getting vaccinated severely outweighs than of being unvaccinated .

This guy in the ""organizing team"" who is a roadies winner I guess. Told me on a fb comment that this demonstration should be only about covid and government negligence to this issue. I said what about corruption, bad system of governance, unemployment, criminals and rapist running free. The guy was this demonstration is only about covid and we would everyone to keep it that way. He said there would be time for other issues. Fuck you bro, should've hit the iron when its hot.

I personally think that this demonstration could have been big. Could have threatened government to work for the people but these few influenza taking control completely lost my hope.

qepb1o,Do u think there will be third wave of covid in Nepal ?,"As per my research   every 4 months after the previous wave end a new wave starts . The same thing happened in USA , UK and other nations . 
If that's the case Nepal will be effected by the new wave of covid earlier than previous years . 
Our government said new wave may start after ashoj 15 but it didn't . Cases are less than 800 these days . 
But new outbreak has been seen in China last few days . Although having a lot of people vaccinated but the cases is rising in different countries including China , and we all know it our neighouring country . It may effect us badly . During this festival season we all know covid has been transmitted a lot due to carelessness . The government said 3rd wave is dangerous for below 18 as they are not vaccinated but the schools and colleges are still open ( not my though ) . This is gonna give us a lot of trouble .

Record 1454 cases in Nepal with 696, almost 700 new cases in KTM valley....

This comes the day after lock down easing....... Now given what happened in the last easing.... in 3 weeks it will be 3000 new cases and 1500 in the valley!

Not saying not to ease lock down but guys n gals alike - PLEASE look after yourselves and limit unnecessary trips outside cos this may not be so lethal but it is contagious and so just take care ok...

When you go out buy more dry goods than needed and just be prepared for a strict lock down over Dashain and Tihar!!!

I everyday monitor the data and so if you want to celebrate Dashain with some normality.... go out with care and do your shopping soon cos this easing of lockdown will not last imo and i suspect we will go through Dashain and Tihar under strict rules sadly.

m7ss5w,Parosmia (distortion in smell) after Covid?,"I was diagnosed with Covid around October. The only symptom I had was loss of smell, which lasted for a few days. By a week, I had already gained my smell back(most of it at least). However, 3 months in (around February), I started getting this very foreign and unpleasant smell from foods. I couldn't figure out exactly what was bothering me, so I asked my family members if they had the same problem, and they denied experiencing any thing like it. I did some research on the internet and found out it was very likely that I had parosmia, alteration of smell. This foreign smell has only intensified since then and now I can't stand to neither smell nor eat any of the common foods that we eat day to day.

Coffee smells like cigarette, the egg whites smell like it's rotten, can't even pin down what the smell I get from onion and garlic is like, it's just vile and rancid and just...sickening. On top of that, I also can't stomach anything with turmeric. Yep, almost 90% of the foods we cook here have turmeric and I can't stand it. Been eating bland and boiled stuff for more than a month now and I'm just tired. Physically. And mentally.

I've tried contacting some people in my circle who had Covid, but none of them have experienced anything like this. At this point, I feel like these smells are going to stick with me forever and I'm going out of my mind.

Have any of you gone through this? If you have, has there been anything that has helped you deal with this? A list of tolerable food, maybe?

yzo928,Travelling to Nepal - Covid Entry requirements,"Hello, 

&#x200B;

I had a question with regards to travelling to Nepal and the covid entry requirements for unvaccinated people as I am unvaccinated.

Do they still check for PCR test results at the the airport when landing in Nepal? 

Because I'm coming in from Canada and based on the outdated government website which has not been updated since March 2022 they say the PCR test is required for Unvaccinated individuals , but not sure if they still enforce that? Because a PCR test in Canada is around $150 CAD.

Nepal govt has almost wasted this entire lockdown period.. no increase in PPEs or ventilators, no ramping up of testing as well.. add to this Indian govt now planning to move thousands of Nepalis near border areas and many will come into Nepal (it is their fundamental right too).. pretty soon.. Gulf countries may then order expulsions of nepali workers and in coming weeks.. Nepal may have to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Nepalis from covid infected areas.. things most probably will get out of hand in a few months.. I hope this is not the case but it's more likely.. our only hope is that the strain of coronavirus that will infect us is less deadly and till now it seems it is as no cases have been sent to ICU.. Covid 19 will remain with us for some time unless we either develop a vaccine or achieve herd immunity.. both of whom will take more than a year.. i don't see how you can extend lockdown for months.

kdqafc,Looking for a job or help for a fantastic Nepalese security guard who normally works in Bangalore but is stuck because of Covid and struggling to support family including a sick child,"I’m from Bangalore, India. In the previous apartment I stayed for 4 years, there was a security guard who was from Nepal. He was one of the best security guards I’ve ever met. Super helpful and dedicated and very enterprising. He self learned English with WhatsApp and talking to residents there and can now speak and write quite decent English. I had always thought he would have done great in life if he had been educated better or from better circumstances.

While I was there, he had a bit of a personal tragedy. His son got muscular dystrophy and he brought him from Nepal to get treatment in Bangalore. It didn’t do a lot of good but he was managing.

He and others used to work in Bangalore for many months then alternately go home to Nepal for a few months to be with family. He had gone a couple of months before Covid and then couldn’t return for nearly 9 months now. He still has the job to go back to but they pay only for months he works. He reached out to me asking for money (i gave some), which is unusual as this is the first time in so many years.

I am reaching out to my old landlord to see if the apartment association will help him. Since I stayed on rent and others I knew moved out, don’t have a lot of connection there anymore.

I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit could help him get a job somewhere in Nepal perhaps.

my9hw8,All about covid misinformation,"So I have been seeing [this](https://imgur.com/I78Fzy9)  post circulating in people's story on instagram.

Let's talk about the symptoms listed.

All these symptoms were already there in the original covid. I especially remember checking my whole body for signs of rashes in early November. I also remember plenty of posts in r/covid19positive about diarrohea in patients and saw in the WHO page as well. Bluish fingers and toes are not limited to new strain either. Confusion state and brain fog isn't something that's new to covid. I  used to have terrible health anxiety and sometime gastritis and these literally cause brain fog and confusion state as well. Only one I don't remember reading in the old covid is conjuctivitis.

About it never showing positive on pcr test, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/mvy3sx/this_is_the_condition_in_new_delhi_new_delhi_has/gvf1m3v?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) one of the doc of this sub said that that is simply not possible.

I'm planning a 4 month stay in Kathmandu. I'd be glad if you could answer some cost of living and Covid-related questions:
1. Around how much is the rent for a standard flat? And how much do you pay with the rent and all the bills included? It doesn't need to be in the city centre or anything fancy but I'll be looking for one which has a kitchen, a bathroom and two separate rooms (can be small-ish).
2. What is the process of finding a flat, is it possible to find them online? If so, what sites would you recommend? Btw, do the locals frequently overcharge tourists? Or is it better to use Airbnb?
3. How is the internet access in Kathmandu? Is it easy to find stable (doesn't need to be fast) internet for video chats? What prices should I expect?
4. Should I know something important that surprised you when you first came to Nepal? Do you maybe have a tip for a newcomer?
5. How is it with Covid in Nepal? What are the restrictions like?
6. There is a PCR test that I have to take after arrival - what is the cost? And how long is the quarantine? Can I spend it in the place of my choosing or should it be one of the official hotels? How much did you pay for it?

izzchj,My COVID19 Experience,"I am a doctor currently working as a frontliner. I was diagnosed with COVID19 almost 14 days back. 

I experienced the following symptoms:

* Myalgia × 7 days

* Fever × 5 days

* Headache × 3 days


I am currently being treated in the hospital I'm working in with:

* Paracetamol- Currently stopped

* Vitamin B, C, D

* Zinc

* Calcium

* Steam inhalation

I am among the lucky ones because I experienced mild symptoms only. My fellow doctors (who happen to be my roommates also) tested negative.  

The facilities provided by the hospital were satisfactory. Food and lodging were not that good but I didn't expect even that. So, that was a pleasant surprise. However, I'm facing a few problems during isolation:

* Low morale: Not being able to meet me currently is hard for my parents. They are very worried about me and so am I for them.

* The curse of knowledge: Having seen apparently healthy and asymptomatic COVID patients collapse before my eyes, first few days and nights were dreadful. You think of all the things that could go wrong instead of things are positive and more hopeful. That's human nature I guess.

Why not stay in home isolation?

That is not possible in my case because it would not be possible to cook and clean without coming in contact with my roommates and I'd have to share the same toilets and everything with them too. So that was not possible. Also, since I had fever it was not a good idea to stay in home isolation.


What I did to spend time during my isolation:

* Read 4 novels

* Watched TV series

* Read textbooks

* I was the only doctor in that ward so did a lot of counseling to my fellow patients. Most of them wanted my opinion on their Chest X-ray.

I found that it is harder for old people to stay in isolation for that long. (Isolation is like living in a jail. You're trapped there no matter what. There was an earthquake a few days back. I didn't even try to get up from my bed because we were trapped in the ward with doors locked from the outside.) So, if you or any of your family members have to stay in isolation in hospital or at home, try to continue your work or education or your hobbies. Empty mind is devil's workshop. Buy a nice radio for old people (who cannot use other gadgets of course) so that they can at least listen to that. 

Do I have any sequelae as of now?

Yes. Weakness and myalgia are still present. Myalgia is now localized with pain in the calf and shoulders only. Could be post COVID sequelae or could be due to prolonged immobilization.

Plans for the future:

* Chest X-ray after getting discharged. I haven't done one yet.

* Plasma donation after 14 days of getting discharged.


Total cost of my treatment:

It is practically zero. Food, bed, medicines are provided by the government. Of course you have to buy everyday items other than that. Such things don't cost much and you get to keep what you buy.

l72yis,I received the second dose of the Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine a week ago. Some thoughts about the Vaccine Nepal got.,"\[Here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/ktogbq/i\_received\_the\_pfizerbiontech\_covid19\_vaccine\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/ktogbq/i_received_the_pfizerbiontech_covid19_vaccine_a/)) is the post about getting the first dose.

So just to quickly recap, 1st dose on 31.12.2020 and 2nd on 21.01.2021. The second dose hit harder. Whereas the first injection just caused a little local pain, the second caused moderate Flu-like symptoms with sub febrile Temperatures, joint pain and Fatigue. These symptoms wore me down enough to require taking one Paracetamol tablet. But all that was just for one day, I still went to work and while working I really wasn't bothered.

The same thing happened to a lot of colleagues and co-workers. Interestingly those who were infected with Covid before had these symptoms after they received the first dose. Just euta Colleague ...thalaa paryo!!.... In general I feel good. Before the second dose I still wore my mask almost constantly and washed my hands intensively like before. I am tempted to try and be more reckless and try to expose myself, but honestly speaking I am still cautious and don't want to risk long term complications.

I am extremely happy that Nepal got some doses of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine. I have my reservations about that vaccine because they aren't 100% transparent with the details about the drawbacks. But at the same time the tests do show promising results.

If I didn't have a choice would I take it? Yes because I'm experimental and if we have to risk anyone why not me? I have studied quite a bit into this vaccine as well. If you guys have questions just leave them in the comments.

flq645,COVID19 and Fear,"There is a lot of fear surrounding Corona virus and a potential outbreak, some of which are justified but also there are a lot of misinformation around including in this sub which I am trying to address here.

Symptoms of Corona Virus includes

1. Fever - According to various studies fever is more likely high grade but it maynot be the case always and low grade (less than 100.4 F has been seen in lesser groups of patient)
2. Fatigue (Getting tired easily)
3. Dry cough
4. Anorexia (Loss of Appetite)
5. Myalgia (Muscle pain)
6. Dyspnea (Difficulty Breathing)
7. Sputum production

Other, less common symptoms can include headache, sore throat, and running nose. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg nausea ie, urge to vomit and diarrhea) may occur

Looking at the symptoms these are vague and can occur in many circumstances ranging from minor common cold to panic attacks (as it seem to be with one of our friends here)

And the infection can have varying degree of severity with patient with mild symptoms (upto 81 percent of the infection)  not knowing that they have the disease or minor symptoms and severe (5 percent) ones having severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.

**I don't believe in Nepali doctors**

Doctors have more knowledge regarding the infection and some random guy sharing weird news so it is better to believe in doctor than believe in those random talk. I will admit that not all doctors have updated themselves so they too may share some misinformation.

Also please visit WHO website for authentic information and myth busting rather than searching on google or checking out posting in facebook.

WHO myth busting

[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters)

**But we haven't test many people**

In an ideal world, it would be great to check each and every person but in the world we live in we have limitations be it human resources, limited testing capacity, monetary issues and such so it is not possible to test each and every one. There is a WHO guideline which defines suspected case, confirmed case and probable case and based on the guideline it should be determined whether or not a person needs to be tested for Corona virus.

I am sparing the details about the guideline ( as it would be very long maybe will add in the comments or will add up it the edit it if someone wants it). Edit : I have added the guidelines below)

I would like us to test a lot more patients and we need to as well but that doesn't mean everyone with fever or cough needs to be tested.

**Tests in Nepal aren't reliable**

Another problem among people is that people have doubts regarding the lab tests. Which is ridiculous. If we don't believe the test what are we supposed to believe, some random guy on facebook?

The test is done with PCR which is very reliable and we do have a lot of experts who know their job so this fear is baseless. Its one think say not many have been tested and other not to believe in the diagnostic test.

**How come we have no patient's diagnosed yet**

There maybe a lot of hidden cases with Corona but for some odd reason they haven't shown up yet. It could be because the infected people have mild symptoms yet and aren't bothered as they think its just the seasonal cold that everyone suffers. It may just be the silence before the storm. So we all need to remain cautious and follow proper hygiene.

**We don't believe in the Nepalese treatment**

Treatment is similar everywhere. We don't have specific drugs to treat the disease till now but like any other viral infection we have nonspecific measures to treat the patients. We are more than capable of a handling such infections but the huge numbers will be the problem.

Once we start having a lot of infections, our health care will be overwhelmed that's for sure and this may result in a higher fatality than in the developed world. So it comes as our responsibility to stay at home unless we start having a more severe symptoms even if we get tested positive.

&#x200B;

**There are a lot of people who aren't being tested or send back home**

I am not justifying why people are not being tested or are being sent home. But the following is the guidelines provided by WHO on whom should be test and whom shouldn't. (Again I am not trying to justify or condem Teku)

According to WHO

A **suspected case** is:

A. a patient with acute respiratory illness (that is, fever and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease, for example,cough or shortness of breath)

* AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation
* AND a history of travel to or residence in a country, area or territory that has reported local transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset

**OR**

B. a patient with any acute respiratory illness AND who has been a contact of a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms

**OR**

C. a patient with severe acute respiratory infection (that is, fever and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease, for example, cough or shortness breath)

* AND who requires hospitalization
* AND who has no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation.

**Recommendations for laboratory testing**

* Any suspected case should be tested for infection with the COVID-19 virus using a molecular test. However, it is possible to test only a subset of suspected cases, depending on the intensity of the transmission, the number of cases and laboratory capacity.
* If resources allow, testing may be done more broadly (for instance, through sentinel surveillance) to better assess the full extent of the circulation of the virus.
* Based on clinical judgment, clinicians may opt to order a test for the COVID-19 virus in a patient who does not strictly meet the case definition, for example, if there is acute respiratory illness among a cluster of health care workers or severe acute respiratory infection or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks.

This 3rd point is often not taken into consideration but it is always be the clinician's judgement in everycase. (This is the reason experience counts) 

I hope they are following the guidelines.

**Final Thought**

We have our fears of not preparing well or having limited health services but there are a lot of baseless fears as well which I have tried to address.  We shouldn't panic, Many of us may get infected with Corona virus but the virus isn't going to kill many of us.

**As of now we need to stay prepared for any kind of scenario that may develop and the most important thing is we need to trust the health official.** (For this reason alone, I quite liked Modi's decision on JanataCurfew- helps to reduce the panic and will like everyone prepared)

I am just a guy with MBBS degree (not and an expert by any means) and no government employee. So I would like to think I have more knowledge than many of us here thus are writhing this to address few of those (don't know if I am able or not, hope I haven't added to more confusion)

hs0cru,Upcoming disaster for middle class Nepalis,"As u guys may or may not know, covid19 has caused havoc in Nepal economy. The country's greatest source of income is drying up. Remmitance. Along with tourism and general production of our daily needs is greatly affected. Banks are panicking as people fail to pay up. People who took loan for trucks and bus for business, land and houses for investments are failing to pay their share of interest to the banks. The last I heard,  thamel area is fast clearing up as well. Meaning commercial estates are badly affected as well. 

Everybody seem to be affected,  price of chicken is at around rs390...thats a 130% increase in 2 or 3 week sala haerda haerdai duud chiya ni rs 25 pughyo mero tol ma!!!. Most importantly, people who took out heavy loans to buy property are in deep shit. Tenants are not paying any rent and most have left the valley. Schools and collages are going to stop paying teachers altogether ...liquidity issue and such. 
Most people working abroad are going to be laid off or get pay reduction. No more easy money coming into circulation. 
 My main concern :
 what I think is going to happen is, middle class Nepalis who made huge investments are going to lose everything & I won't be surprised if people start hanging themselves, and these properties and businesses will be bought by the wealthy people at a very discounted price. People who are loaded with cash and who can wait for a year or 2 will hugely benefit. Every majority stake and shares in companies ,  every physical properties, lands etc will fall into the hands of very few families. And yes,  much of it will be bought for by black money. 

I think Wealth inequality is going to be a huge problem in Nepal as well, which Is not helpful to the already poor nation.

The Nepali embassy and consulate in the US and the US embassy in Nepal have inconsistent and unclear information. Also, none of them are picking up the phone or returning emails. If anyone can help with any of the following questions that would be incredibly helpful:

-Is a tourist visa on arrival available now? According to this article it is, but the embassy websites do not say anything -https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/nepal-relaxes-entry-for-tourists/

-The Nepali government website says a ""recommendation letter from Department of Tourism/Nepal Tourism Board for participation in any tourism activities within Nepal"" is required - does anyone know how to obtain this? Does it need to be obtained in my home country?

-I have seen on Reddit that a vaccinated traveler only has to quarantine until they receive a negative COVID19 test after arriving in Nepal. Where does one get these tests and how long does it take for the result?

rjv30m,Nepal Tourism during New Years,"Hello All,

Hope you’re safe and keeping well.

I’m interested in visiting Nepal for 4-5 days from India over the new year period and was wondering whats the on ground situation? There is a lot information out there which is hard to follow. I’m fully vaccinated against Covid19. 

I love the mountains and would like to have some peaceful time off in some nice locations. Remote locations are fine as well if the connectivity is good. Places with a combination of good local food, local markets, cafes would be ideal. Idea would be to just walk around, eat good food, explore nearby areas and just relax.

I’m okay with just a couple of places, don’t necessarily want to cover too many places and lose out on enjoying the travel. Budget is not a concern. 

I have a few questions if you guys don’t mind answering:

1. Is it safe to travel for a fully vaccinated person keeping necessary precautions in mind?

2. Apart from Kathmandu, what are some places you’d recommend for peaceful getaways with good views of the valleys/mountains? I have 4-5 days inclusive of travel to & fro to Mumbai (India).

Thanks in advance. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/rjv30m/nepal_tourism_during_new_years/,12/19/2021 11:39,1,0,4,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

gnd3d4,Have you ever tried the Hamro Swastha app by the Health ministry of Nepal?,"App link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.naxa.covid19

Disclaimer: I have not tested this app myself. There is no way I am even considering installation of this app if they dont remove suspicious features and if they release the source code.

So I found it and I was confused. Why on Earth would I consider using such app? Its a malware, let me explain why.

1: This app wants to turn on Bluetooth for seemingly no reason and is not mentioned by the Terms of Service(to this date of posting this). Consider whats written in Description is Google Play Store

>Hamro Swasthya is a Nepal Government tool for information dissemination.

>Hamro Swasthya is a mobile application developed by Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal to provide reliable information on important health to Nepali citizens. At this time of COVID-19 global pandemic, this app is dedicated towards COVID-19 control and awareness, but the overall target of the application is to cover all health related issues in coming days.

2: Its made by the Government of Nepal, and yet its closed source. Its a shame because a Government body should have no reason not to publish the source code if they have nothing malicious to hide.

3: Many people in the app reviews section claim that they are unable to register a phone number, a phone number? For an app that only shows you the correct stats of coronavirus infection? Thats some next level thing.

mxlgv1,"[Important] Educational institutions, Covid-19, terminal exams and the selfish businessmen","

'ello Everyone, Nepal's total no. of cases for covid-19 has been increasing rapidly. Recently, India has added 314,835 cases of covid in a single day. From the following chart

https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/mvt1g3/notice_a_pattern_top_graph_is_india_bottom_is/

It can be observed that India and Nepal have similar pattern of increment/decrement in covid. In India the no. of cases are going very high, similarly in Nepal too. This is the current situation of Covid in Nepal.
Educational institutions have started posting various updates regarding the upcoming exams within this month. The covid cases doesn't seem to decrease. The exams are supposedly important to students as they are the 'terminal' exams. The Educational institutions are indirectly forcing the students to come to school/college as the institutions are scared of the second lockdown that may cause various payment issues. Also, the general public will face a lot of risks if students are sent to school. First of all, there is a chance that even though the young people(the students) reading in the institutions may not face the symptoms, they may still
act as a bridge to contaminate and infect weak people(grandparents, parents, infants etc.) Secondly, It is NOT SURE that they may not show any symptoms. There is an ongoing rumor that the new variant of the covid may actually be more dangerous to youths too.

Also, let's talk about a little bit of common sense and our past steps. In 2019, Before the SEE examination there was a decision that the examination was cancelled. This is during the period in which nepal has less than 100 cases. Also, there was a kind of strict lockdown. The cases started going high up after around 4 months as the general public was forced to start working and the fear of covid was less than before. Hey, this didn't go well ok? But now there are THOUSANDS of VERIFIED cases. Educational institutions go, ""hey about we take exams ey mate? we don't need payment issues like last year, right?"" . Also the cabinet HASN'T STILL done lockdown. Listen. Listen to me. The neighbouring india is going bullocks on no of covid cases.
Let me enlighten you with two more words, ""OPEN BORDERRRRRRRRR"". Yes, so much fun living here innit?

1eqfy40,Just a rant of a 21 y/o student in Nepal.,"Imagine being that student in Nepal, scrolling through Instagram, watching all your friends living their best lives in abroad. They're posting about their new campuses, high-tech classrooms, wild parties, and road trips along scenic highways. You can practically smell the freedom and opportunity in their photos. Meanwhile, you’re stuck here, in a country where the economy feels like it’s hanging by a thread, and every day is a reminder that you’re not ""living your best life.""  
  
Your friends are out there experiencing a world that you’ve only seen in movies. They’re networking with people from different countries, building their futures, and making memories that will last a lifetime. And you? You’re dealing with power cuts, erratic internet, and an education system that sometimes feels like it's stuck in the 90s. They talk about their internships at big tech companies or startups, while you’re figuring out how to make the most out of a degree that might not even get you a decent job here.  
  
It’s like the universe conspired to remind you daily of what you’re missing out on. They’re getting a head start in the global race, and you’re just trying to keep up in a country where the job market is shrinking, and the cost of living is rising. It’s frustrating, disheartening, and sometimes, it feels like no one really gets it unless they’re in the same boat.  
  
You see your friends getting these experiences that make them glow with newfound confidence, while you’re trying to navigate a system that doesn’t always reward talent or hard work. There’s this gnawing feeling in your gut that maybe, just maybe, if things were different, you could have been out there with them, living that life too.  
  
But here’s the kicker—no one talks about the pressure you’re under. The pressure to make something out of nothing. The pressure to stay optimistic in a country where every day feels like an uphill battle. And the worst part? You’re supposed to be grateful for what you have, while secretly dreaming of what could have been.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1eqfy40/just_a_rant_of_a_21_yo_student_in_nepal/,8/12/2024 14:58,163,0,110,English,0,0,1,0,1,2

It was reported later that the parents of the students went to India to get their bodies. But since then, there seems to have been no follow up to this case. People related to the deceased reported to me that this was a case of local goons harassing the two when they were waiting for their train at the station and then when the two victims stood up to them, the gang mercilessly beat the boy and possibly assaulted the girl, and then threw them both alive at the train tracks. But mind you, the details are not direct eyewitness accounts, so we have to be careful before jumping to conclusions.

I am posting it here because it seems that neither the Indian media nor the Nepali media, or the social media seems to have picked up the case. Considering the horrific details of this case, it really surprised me how this incident was so ignored everywhere. We don't know if this was an accident or a crime, and if this was a crime, why wasn't there any legal proceedings. Even I was very active in the social media, including Reddit, but I have to confide that I only heard about this case for the first time. I am sure that the Nepali community in Bangalore know a lot more about this case.

Anyway, I hope that this post catches the eye of this community and somehow we will know what were the true details of this incident. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1f7wh4s/the_case_of_2_nepali_engineering_students_a_girl/,9/3/2024 10:24,148,0,32,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1ca0gdy,A confused student from middle class family,"When i completed 12th in 2022 taking science, i was a pretty average student as everyone else. Just after finishing 12th, there was a huge hype of students to go abroad, saying there is nothing good abt staying in nepal and yall AND i was also one of em. Deciding this as a naive 17 yr old, i started IELTS and joined for abt a month. And due to various reasons and i had to give up on that thought. I started studying bba in TU after that , as many of my friends chose it cause it was a reasonable decision for any student who had no aims and went with the flow as i thought it would eventually help me. There was also underlying thought that.. i also want to go abroad, cus from as a middle class family.. that would have been a huge. After i completed my 1st sem.. as various things progressed i convinced my family that i didn't want to read here at all and that bba was not for me. My two of my friends along with me then started pte and things happened got 74 score as well.. then i started applying for aus.. and was rejected gte at end of mangsir iirc because i was very late at applying. I was skeptical and doubtful of my decision but still i went for it. And as a result
Here i am now.. completey wasted two years of my life.. pressured heavily from family of my naive ambition and no one to consult. Since then 3/4 mnths have passed and I haven't done antg for it. I decided that i won't continue bba from the experience of my 1st sem.. my migration certificate is still at the TU and i don't know what to do as a  student.

We are worried because the cases are growing every day, and the situation is getting worse as the third wave has been confirmed. 

Furthermore, I have a grandpa who has laryngitis. My mother suffers from heart disease. I have an infant 9-month-old younger sister. If it were only me who would be infected with the virus that would be fine. **But my entire family is at risk**. **That** is why we're against the exams. The exams of the last year and the physical exams of bachelors have proven in amplitude that the guidelines will not be followed and enforced. And to those smart alecks who say that bachelors exams are going on so continue the exams, that is not our primary concern. We have made a stand and reluctantly albeit, NEB and CCMC, and the Ministry of Health are holding meetings regarding it. It is both the failure of TU students and the administration that the students did not make a proper stand and the administration did not hear them out. Do not project those failures onto us, and do not generalize us. We haven't generalized the Bachelor students, and are even aiding them, bringing up their exams in our meetings with the NEB as well, and this is the gratitude we get? This mentality is horrific. When we looked at our elders, we expected to support, and aid from people whom we assumed would simply look at the covid data charts and understand our plea. But in the end, we are being vilified and trodden upon. This mentality shows why our politics is so broken and why our country is so dysfunctional.

I am not asking for your pity, all of your rude and insensitive comments in various other threads had made aware to me that this is a folly, I am simply asking you all not to trod upon us or vilify us if support is out of the question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/oyzfed/i_am_a_grade_12_student_stop_vilifying_us_for/,8/6/2021 4:23,105,0,61,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
1g8q1j1,Student's problem (suggestion needed),"by the way i am a boy!

I am studying at Thapathali Campus. I came to Kathmandu two years ago, and before that, I had never been here. Living in a rented room has been really difficult for me; it feels like hell. It’s not that I want freedom, but the landlords I’ve encountered so far have been inhumane. I’ve had to change rooms every semester. Some landlords increase the rent every month, while others impose strict rules, like not making noise (which is fine for me) and not inviting anyone, even family members.

I used to live with a friend, but I found it hard to concentrate on my studies, so I decided to live alone. However, I only receive 9,000 to 10,000 NPR from home. I haven’t mentioned these issues to my parents because I know they would overreact and worry. I’m okay with spending 5,000 NPR on rent; I can manage other expenses like travelling to college by bus, room expenses.

The main reason I’m posting this is to seek suggestions. What should I do? I want to stay alone, so are there any rooms or places you recommend? Or do you have any better options to help me get out of this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1g8q1j1/students_problem_suggestion_needed/,10/21/2024 13:44,7,0,2,English,1,0,1,0,0,2

What are the tech companies that are generally open for sponsorship for tech events . We need one main title sponsor, co-sponsor , title wise sponsors. 
The main events are : 
-Hackathon
- project showcase 
- maze solving robot competition 
- AI talk 
- Entertainment and networking session .

This program is targeted for students from grade  8-12  so we cant charge much for registration and entry fees . We need some help on how to sustain this event .  

Can you please help us by giving names of companies and contact details of person responsible for this kind of task? 

Any others tips or ideas are also welcome. 

Note : our school is not helping in organising so its solely student based .

1cllh5r,+2 student requiring career guidance,"So I passed my +2 a year before and originally I had no intention in going abroad. But due to some influence I changed my mind and let's say I was half way through, had given my ielts but I realised there's no meaning for me to go abroad right now and I decided to go with my original opinion and stay here in Nepal. 

Now I've had a year gap, which doesn't bother me at all it rather helped me to get a fresh mind and have a fresh beginning, but now the problem arises. I had completely planned out which path I'll go in Nepal however the path I traced now feels not the best choice. I decided I'll join bba and start working part time, trying to score good in studies and earning some pocket money too.


But as the time passes I'm realising BBA is not really a great course and if I don't end up being a phenomenal student in bba and prove my worth by different kind of skills, just the bba certificate won't do much.


Finally, now I'm in a crisis cause the plan I laid out has completely been shattered ,for now atleast, so I need someone to help me with it. I want to know what I should study and please don't say just follow your passion and study what you are interested in cause that's the problem I can't figure it out 
Well tbh I just wanna earn money, ik everyone wants to but I wanna start from now so I want a subject which will give me time to earn as well as study

Should I enter the IT field? Should I try some other financial courses? Idk 

It's not that I'm just searching people to guide me in reddit I'm also searching irl but if there's someone who has gone through what I'm going through please can you help me or anyone if you have any guidance you can give me ill happily accept :)

1de4hyd,Just another TU rant from a frustrated student,"Right now in my 3rd year of BSC physics right now. The second year results just came out and I failed. Not just me most of my classmates have failed. Even among the ones who passed they have really shit grades. The thing is all of us failed in differential equations. How? I don't know almost all of us who failed got around 17-19 marks. That's only around 3ish questions of the exams.

The real gut puncher is the fact that this is the first time that our class actually studied really hard. For context, during first year most of our classes were online (lockdown) and the exams happened out of the blue. None of us were prepared, heck our course was nowhere near complete, we weren't even sure if we wanted to stay in Nepal, in fact most of us tried going abroad, with few of my friends succeeding. So, we gave our exams half heartedly and still most of us managed to get decent grades (above 65%), none of my close friends failed.

Since, for better or worse, we knew that we were stuck in Nepal for bachelors , all of us started studying really hard. Sometimes, we were in discord video call trying to hold each other accountable if we used our phones or get distracted in other ways. Watching countless lectures and writing really good notes that covered almost every corner of our course is how we spent almost 2 months before the exams. (We kinda felt like those ""productive"" youtubers who study for 8 hours or something)

Even during the exams except for a few questions here and there almost none of us really stumbled. The differential paper was difficult because a couple of questions were confusing and rarely asked in the past 10 years but still we were expecting around 50ish out of 75. I still remember us walking out our final exam and calculating our marks, we were confident that we were getting an easy distinction (75%)

Now the results are out and boom most of the class has failed. Even among the ones who have passed most of them have barely 60 precent. None of us know how this can even happen.  We may be dumb in some regards but not stupid enough to fail by getting 17-19. The ones who have passed in differential only did so by getting barely passing marks (27-29).

I know that ""grades don't matter"" and all that stuff but I don't know man this shit is downright disheartening. We kinda wish we could get our checked papers or something to know how we ended up screwing up this badly.

I don't know anymore. Just fed up with TU, from the delayed exams and results to shit re exam timing to them losing answer sheets. Wish we would have just gathered the courage to lose a year and go abroad instead of studying here.

1d8pw7o,"BHM and pkus 2 students, please be aware of such scandalous int degree college in KTM. ","

So recently, I was involved with a BHM college. Normally bachelors teachers get paid nrs 1000 above per hour per class. We negotiated and said I would work for 950 per hour. Worked there for a semester, and when it's time to get paid, they tell me it's just rs. 800 per hour. During the time I requested them to form a contract and also provide salary every month, they denied. Later we settled for rs. 850 per hour (tax should be paid by institution) 

According to rs. 850 per hour, my monthly income is supposed to be 20,400. I taught there for 2 semester. I only got rs. 120k until now (supposed to be 244,800).

They also took my companie's service (npr rs. 190k per month). Initially they gave 1st months fee and 2nd months half installment. After that, they never paid us for rest of the year. They used our service for 9 plus months. We have a contract with them, yet they don't want to pay us. 

Today we had a meeting with the principle, they basically don't want to pay. 

Background about the college: they claim the cost for getting their bachelors degree (2 year) is rs. 800,000. Their plus 2 program costs nrs. 300,000. In reality, when they send students for internship (required by them since it's a hm college) they charge rs. 200k to 500,000. The above figures are per student basis.

Funny thing is, it is European degree but most US, Australian and UK unis apparently don't recognize them.

 Here are a list of subjects and how how I feel about it :
1)Math: Bane to my existence although the teacher has cut out the syllabus to only 10 chaps I don’t know shit about Trigonometry, limits and differentiation which together carry 40 marks. 
Other miscellaneous chapters like Sets, Stats I think I can. 
2)Eco:I am confident and it is quite easy but a shit ton to cover up 
3)Business Studies: It’s pretty easy but there are about 2 copies full of notes which I have not even started 
4) Accounts: I know all the chapters and concepts but not even started like all the others: 
5)Literature: Manageable 
6)Grammar: Manageable

Here are a few of the requirements, that I could think of.

\- Should be energy efficient  
\- Should last without any problems for at least 4 years.

  
We've found a couple of brands like Olive and Gem on Daraz with some ratings, but it's hard to find detailed reviews or unboxing videos. We're open to other brand recommendations that are available in Nepal.

  
Does anyone have experience or recommendations for a fridge that fits these criteria? Personal experiences, brand suggestions, or any pointers on what to look out for would be incredibly helpful.

17kp0z1,What should I learn as a 3rd year Software Engineering student?,"
Hello everyone,

I just finished my 4th semester as a Software Engineering undergraduate, till now I havent quite started learning any programming languages or any skills yet. I have cleared my exams of first 3 semesters and dont have any backlogs on java, c or c++ but still i dont know those languages cause I only learnt them as to clear my exams.

I have been very anxious about what I am gonna do in the future if this keeps going on as its already been too late. I really wanna start learning but I am a procastinator and I cant quite figure out what language should I learn. I dont quite seem as interested in creating websites using html, css, javascript etc. On our project on 4th sem, my team submitted a project we found on the internet. So for the project in 6th sem I dont wanna do the same thing by copying so i wanna learn frontend but i feel like maybe i am interested in cyber security so i seems like its waste of time to learn frontend if im gonna pursue cyber security(CS) cause at the same time i could be learning about CS. My point is I wanna learn the skills that will help me land an internship or a  job  in future as well I need to learn the skills that I would need to do my 6th and 8th sem projects on.

Please give me recommendations about what should I learn?

My goal is to land a remote job and earning in dollars while living in Nepal. So I need a full roadmap as to what should I do to make that come true. Please tell me about your journeys like what did you learn how did you land the job etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/17kp0z1/what_should_i_learn_as_a_3rd_year_software/,10/31/2023 16:27,4,0,6,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

1f4l53d,Flatmates Wanted: Max Rent 20k Around Chabahil,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently living alone in Chabahil and need to move out of my 2-room flat before Dashain (Oct/Nov 2024). I'm looking for 2 flatmates to share a flat with, making a total of 3 people (including myself).

**Key Details:**

* **Max Rent:** 20,000 NPR
* **Room:** I need a single room
* **Shared Spaces:** We can share the kitchen and divide groceries and other items

**Location Preferences:**

* Chabahil
* Maijubaal
* Gaurighat
* Bhatkeko Pool
* Naxal
* Kapan

A bit about me: I'm a software engineer, and I appreciate a quiet and respectful living environment. If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please reach out!

**Additional Information:**

If the two flatmates are students studying in the same class, they can stay in the same room if they are happy to do so. In that case, you can add one more person in a hall, which will make a total of 4. Otherwise, there is no compulsion. One can stay in a separate room, and the other can stay in a hall. Three people—two in separate rooms and one in a hall—is a fair deal, I think. If you are not willing to stay in a hall, I’ll take that step on one condition: we’ll maintain no noise.

Let’s make this happen! Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kathmandu/comments/1f4l53d/flatmates_wanted_max_rent_20k_around_chabahil/,8/30/2024 3:05,4,0,4,Roman & English,0,0,0,1,0,1

1e40x6o,Informatics College Pokhara,"The reality of Informatics College Pokhara (ICP) is far uglier than its polished image suggests:

Social Media Smoke Screen: ICP's marketing strategy is all sizzle, no steak. They flood social media with glossy ads and influencer partnerships, masking their educational inadequacies with fancy production values. It's a bait-and-switch tactic that lures in unsuspecting students.

Scholarship Scam: Their financial aid system is a farce. Academic merit? Irrelevant. They're handing out scholarships based on how well you fit their marketing narrative. Genuine talent goes unrewarded while social media darlings get the perks.

Faculty of Failures: No comments but the instructors are the blind leading the blind.

Degree to Nowhere: That BIT degree you're shelling out 9+ lakhs for? In my experience, it's about as useful as toilet paper in the job market. You're paying premium prices for bargain-basement education.

Evaluation Charade: Forget rigorous testing. ICP's idea of assessment is a joke - submit any project, no matter how half-baked, with a glossy report, and you're golden. I've seen gibberish code pass because no one bothers to actually check.

Echo Chamber of Complaints: Those monthly surveys? A complete waste of time. We screamed about the abysmal teaching quality until we were blue in the face, but it's like shouting into a void. Zero improvements, zero accountability.

False Prestige: They trumpet their British university affiliation like it's a golden ticket. Spoiler alert: the education quality has more in common with a street-corner scam than any respectable international standard.

Education Inc.: ICP isn't a college; it's a business masquerading as one. Your tuition isn't funding your education; it's lining someone's pockets while you're left with subpar skills and a worthless degree.

The 'Production Ready' Lie: ICP's boldest scam is promising to make you 'production ready'. What a joke. Most graduates couldn't code their way out of a paper bag, let alone handle a real-world project. It's like promising to turn you into a master chef after teaching you to boil water.

Regulatory Negligence: Tribhuvan University's (TU) oversight of ICP is a joke. They're rubber-stamping equivalence for a program that's a mockery of higher education. TU needs to wake up and investigate before they further tarnish Nepal's academic reputation.

In three years, I encountered a grand total of three instructors who seemed to know what they were doing. Three. The rest? Overpaid, underqualified seat-warmers.

You're welcome to ICP if your parents are rich and for me I wasted my parents money. That's what haunts me.

Compare this to any other colleges, where friends are getting real education, rigorous assessments, and actual job prospects. The difference is night and day.

To anyone considering ICP: Run. Fast. This place isn't a stepping stone to your future; it's quicksand. You're not investing in education; you're falling for an elaborate con.

1cxo0ju,A grave concern on health-products on Daraz,"I recently bought a Dermaroller on Daraz and it didn't look new. That got me into thinking whether it was a returned product and if there is a possibility that someone else has used it before. If they have, any disease the previous buyer has might transfer to me if I use the said product.

That got me into thinking if Daraz has systems and processes in place that prevents returned items from being resold. You might say ""used products would look used"", but you see, for most products sold in Daraz, they aren't sealed and most products don't show signs of uses in a short period of time. Hence, buyer could ""assume"" with plausible deniability that the returned product hasn't been used and might resell the product.

I think, the proper thing for Daraz to do here is to ensure that returned products are reasonably returned and they are destroyed without taking the risk of transferring the disease to another user.

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1cxo0ju/a_grave_concern_on_healthproducts_on_daraz/,5/22/2024 1:05,1,0,1,English,1,0,0,0,0,0

1bcrtn4,Private health insurance in Nepal,"As the title suggests, I am looking for any suggestions on what companies offer private health insurance coverage. I am not involved with any organizations/companies work-wise at the moment and this would be solely to cover myself for any regular medical expenses/checkups/treatments etc.



Key things I am looking for coverage are

- Regular/annual medical checkup (last time I did one in a private clinic it was around 20k for a full package, maybe its gone up even more)

- Any unforeseen screenings (some xrays, MRIs can get costly)

- Any unforeseen costly medications and/or  treatment

- InPatient hospital bills can be expensive even here in Nepal (for private hospitals) so something that would cover a fraction of those would be helpful



P.S. I dont have any existing conditions and consider myself healthy but imo its always a good option to have health insurance with you. I might be wrong but my impression was that the government-provided insurance only works with sarkari hospitals and lately there were even some news about holdups on many hospitals regarding clearing of the insurance dues.

I have already been in the market once before but some of the providers I checked only had options for add-ons that cover ""deadly and serious"" diseases such as strokes, cancers, permanent disability etc on top of their life insurance plans. But ideally it would be nice and reassuring to have something I could turn to in case of less serious conditions and/or regular visits.

19e8asm,"I won't go to any foreign country, ever.",">Disclaimer: This is my own opinion, and don't want to harm other's sentiments. 

Yes, I am Nepali and do not want to go to any foreign country. That's not like I admire my country more than me, tbh ""F\*\*k Nepal's system"", it's bcoz I admire my family and friends. Nowadays, everybody shows that going foreign is success itself, but for me, success is to be happy and to be happy I need to be mentally sound, and to be mentally sound, I need to be around my family and friends.

**Why I won't go?**

1. Don't want leveraged lifestyle.
2. Don't want to waste time without my old parents and friends.
3. Don't want to feel like I didn't give time to my family in the last ride. 
4. The position (financial condition), where I am right now is may not enough for me but having more than that without my mental health will be more not enough for me. 
5. Don't want to live in a feeling of loniness.

h9b4uc,Recent Mental Health Posts on Social Media: An Unpopular Opinion,"After Sushant Singh Rajput's sad demise yesterday, I have seen a lot of people posting on social media urging people who are going through mental health issues to reach out to them. This might be an unpopular opinion but I think this might not be for the best.

First of all, It is a good thing that so many people want to help. But, wanting to help and knowing how to help are two different things. Helping a person who is on the verge of taking their own life is not like everyday regular conversations, or even like consoling a friend who is feeling down. You talking to them once will not make their issues go away. Sometimes they will talk about things that you cannot comprehend or understand and never will. If you do not know the right thing to say in those moments then you could also make it worse for them! This can lead to frustration for you also! Before you offer someone help, you must be sure that you will be there for them. From what I have seen, most of us are busy and caught up on our own issues. It is not always possible to be there for someone else.

I have been pretty close to some people with mental health issues. From my experience, me talking to them and trying to offer them suggestions did not magically make them feel better. I tried to give suggestions because I did not know what else to do or say but I wanted to do something to help. I could not relate to how they felt. Depression is not like the regular ""I'm feeling down today"" feeling. How could I give suggestions about an experience that I could not relate to? I was just being stupid.

I think it would be better if people would just be supportive and try to erase the stigma around mental health issues rather than offering help. Talking to them is one thing but telling them that it will be better and that they just need time to heal or something along those lines is a bad idea. The bottom line is that if you cannot relate to them or are not trained then you alone cannot help them no matter how much you want to. I think it's a better idea to help them seek out professional help. Depression is an illness after all and like every other illness, a professional knows best how to deal with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/h9b4uc/recent_mental_health_posts_on_social_media_an/,6/15/2020 7:11,49,0,24,English,0,0,1,0,1,2

Me and my friend live in ktm and he have mental disorder called ocd . He told about that to his parent, and they just made him awkward. I want him to consult a doctor. Do you guys have any idea how can I do so? Which hospital should I go?  

 Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning.

### Obsession symptoms

OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things.

Obsessions often have themes to them, such as:

* Fear of contamination or dirt
* Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty
* Needing things orderly and symmetrical
* Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others
* Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects

Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include:

* Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched
* Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove
* Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way
* Images of driving your car into a crowd of people
* Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public
* Unpleasant sexual images
* Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands

### Compulsion symptoms

OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety.

You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix.

As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as:

* Washing and cleaning
* Checking
* Counting
* Orderliness
* Following a strict routine
* Demanding reassurance

Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include:

* Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw
* Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked
* Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off
* Counting in certain patterns
* Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase
* Arranging your canned goods to face the same way",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/ygovru/i_tell_my_parents_about_my_mental_health/,10/29/2022 17:02,7,0,3,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

I have been feeling light headed since couple of weeks and it gets worse when I walk.

I have caught cold on top of that and I feel and look like a zombie more than a human. 

I went to give my exam and everything was fine until I enter the college premises, my heart rate increased and I felt I was swaying. Cold made it worse. Even though I was prepared for the exam I went blank and could hardly concentrate. Even the easy question suddenly started troubling me. Even though I will pass both of my exam and am prepared for the rest exam, i feel like my grades are going to go down this semester due to me not being physically and mentally fit. 


Now I am on dilemma whether I should attend rest of the exams or not. I don't think I can perform to my fullest and I feel like what's happened will repeat again.

  Today he completely forgot his way, even though it was known route to him. (According to him)
  He left from his work to home, Satdobato to Mahalaxmisthan. But, he was like he forgot the way, he was driving continuously and went to Bhaisipati where he felt like where the fuck was he, and then he again went to Bhanimandal to sanepa to Pulchowk. While all these mentioned place were known to him. And then later he came to Patan hospital, till this time he was still where the fuck he was! Then he came to the house when he kinda figured it out!! 
He told this to us later when we were having dinner!!

So my question is how this is possible??? Like can someone completely be unaware of the familiar places too?? 
 According to him, he haven’t had his medicine for 5 days which he takes for his heart!!
Is it something related with that medicine or is it starting phase of Alzheimer ? Or is it related with Johnson & Johnson vaccines?? (Coz he took that one)

Can anyone suggest what kind of packages would be suitable for 50 years old male and female? What are the necessary tests that screens them for eveything from B.P and sugar to ulcers, cancers. Also, any suggestions for hospitals that aren't insanely expensive but provides decent care with good equipments would be amazing.

nqbxb7,Why do we have problem with health care and doctors/nurses?,"We are having a lot of discussions about health care in social media and in this sub as well. I have worked being a medical professional in both Nepal and in one of the developed country. I am trying to analyze why there is the difference.

1. Pay: Doctors are paid handsomely in almost every country in the world excluding few countries likely Nepal. In US average general salary is 40,000 dollars a year where as starting salary of a doctor is 230000 dollars. This difference is due to the high hours or work and nature of doctors job which is stressful. Similarly it takes a lot of time and effort to be a doctor. In Nepal government employee who work 6-7 hrs a day and a government doctor have almost same salary. In private hospitals medical officer make less than 30,000. So less salary less motivation to work. The condition of nurses is even pathetic. They are working for 12-15000 a month.

2. Over work: In developed country a doctor sees limited number of patient. An ICU nurse sees 2 patients. In Nepal we have no limit, so the care is definitely going to be compromised. I think there are about 2200 gov doctors in Nepal. They have not even opened the vacancy during pandemic.

3.Lack of resources: we lack resources.  For example let’s take dialysis. Patient’s in developed country have a very long life due to adequate dialysis facility where as in Nepal you know the scenario. Believe me the worst most of you have seen is much better than in the rural places of Nepal.

4. Business: In Nepal hospitals are being business. If businessmen open hospital with the intention of profit you are gonna be overcharged. Actually health care should be free and if that is not possible at least it should be approachable with minimal insurance.

5.Culture: Medical professional in Nepal sometimes feel they are superior. Sometimes they do not listen to patients. Actually medical field is also a job. Public also should understand there are disease complications. People can sometime deteriorate in hospital. This days people are born in hospital and die in hospital. Every hospital death is not malpractice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/nqbxb7/why_do_we_have_problem_with_health_care_and/,6/2/2021 3:10,7,0,6,English,1,1,0,0,0,2

npvx5w,Lockdown Mental Health Issues,"I was kinda critical of people whining about mental health during  the lockdown last year, and for most of last year I was feeling slightly  normal.  


But this lockdown, for me I feel like I've really started to slip, I'm not even a shadow of who I was a year ago. My salary has been cut 50%, I don't have any motivation even for just keeping my flat clean or calling my friends. I am not very hopeful about the future and all this alone time is bringing up regret about past things. Maybe this is what those soaring mental health issues were about. I have not even eaten or slept well for about a week now. If people were feeling like this during the first lockdown, I feel for them. I am not sure how I was able to get out of the first one just fine,  but people who had already fallen on hard times before this must be feeling worse.

I've tried to get out  of this and some of the things I've mentioned below help, but it's  really hard to continue with this everyday. If you guys have something helpful to say, I'm all ears:

1. I've started treating self-care like an intentional project, I'm noticing things that make me feel  better and worse, and started focusing to the former.  
2. Exercise is helping, light 30 minutes workout makes me feel good after and is helping with sleep.  
3. Reach out to people you really care about occasionally. I received a surprise Birthday Cake & some food from Khaanpin at mignight, sent from my friend and I felt really valued and good. I'll repeat the gesture for someone  else.  
4. I had ordered 2 books from Mandala, I've read at least one  paragraph everyday. It might seem very less, but I've always fallen in a rut when aiming for more and ultimately feeling bad about myself.  Reading less is doable and I feel I've at-least accomplished something.

1824z4o,Democracy has not failed. The corrupted politicians have slowed down growth.,"During the Monarchy, resources were misallocated or not allocated all. The rural parts of the country was very poor. There was little economic activity happening. People only 20 years ago were very poor. Ask your parents. They were likely in the villages farming and living a subsistence lifestyle. My parents both were before they god married.

Democracy empowered all parts of the country. We saw rapid building of roads. We saw power lines reach all parts of tue country. These roads enabled for people to come to KTM or to parts of Terai easily. This migration and the subsequent globalization opened Nepal up to the world. The migration would probably not have been possible under the Monarchy whose motto was, “Aafno gau afai banaune”. 

A point about migration that was a result of roads being built: Economic theory argues that migration is good because it leads to efficient allocation of human capital. People can move to where the jobs are. They can move to where businesses are. This leads rapid urbanization which comes with benefits in education as well.

People are obviously going to leave for jobs abroad, that’s basic economics. The problem is not that people are leaving in droves—a lot of them can be compelled to move back. However, them moving back is not important. The problem is that the rate at which these people are leaving is high. Meaning every year some % of the population leaves. If the country was functioning better, people would still leave but at a smaller percentage.

The only thing we should look at is year over year growth rate. If you look at historical data, in 2017 gdp growth was 9%. ‘18, 7.6. ‘19, 6.7. This growth would have likely continued if not for the pandemic. Nepal is improving in almost all metrics imaginable. Quality of education has gone up because people could move to KTM to educate their kids.

What we see happening now—I like to give the example of dozer साउ—is that the people who led the development of the country, a lot of them dozer साउ, are finding ways to cheat the system and keep their hold on power. 

Many mayors and ward adakxyas have made their money through construction. This is happening because there isn’t a check on their power. The three party system only enables this for the incumbency of the 3dal prefers to remain as such. 

The constitution was promulgated in 2015. Democracy is only 8 years old in Nepal. People have not learned to wield their democratic powers. Democracy is not just voting, it’s being able to run for election, campaign for an idea and bring that idea into reality. This was not a luxury the Monarchy offered.

So what’s next? What do we do to remain optimistic?
We need to learn to use our democratic power. Balen, Harka, Rabi and RSP have shown us that democracy can work. This needs to be scaled across the country. We need to see competitive elections. The root of the evils are the three dals. I come from a Congress household but recognize that while I agree with their “democratic ideology” over the socialists, I do not believe Congress, UML and Maobadi have a place in the Parliament. 

So let’s make change, not by petitioning for the return feeble ex-Monarch and a failed and obsolete political system. But by running for local and federal elections. 84 can be an inflection point where the country votes against corruption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1824z4o/democracy_has_not_failed_the_corrupted/,11/23/2023 16:30,54,0,63,Nepali & English,0,1,0,1,0,1

1dp2bnl,Why are Nepali people okay with corrupt politicians?,"We all know that there aren't many suitable candidates to be prime ministers. We all know that Prachanda bought the votes, and he is one of the most corrupt politicians in Nepal. There is news about him killing 5,000 people; if that's true, then he should be in jail instead of being the prime minister. The country has drowned and is doomed, yet there hasn't been much progress made by the PM or the other politicians or people who are responsible for the development of the nation. The economy has gone downhill; a big recession has still been going on. The primary account of the share market has been banned for six months in Nepal because the finance minister hasn't found his own ally or known candidate for the post. It's one of the reasons why the economy is not growing. The roads are constructed and repaired with cheap materials and products, which is one of the main reasons for the air pollution. I don't understand why people are okay with this when they clearly know that the people in power for the development of the nation's economy, betterment, development, and more are mostly corrupt and don't care much about citizens lives and welfare. I understand that there are lots of uneducated and less wealthy people in Nepal, but they should also think about the country's situation and its overall development. There should be common sense among the people. The corrupted and undeserving politicians and PMs shall be removed from their positions by replacing them with suitable and deserving candidates. I think the citizens should start a revolution, rally and fight for their rights, and complain for their lives and for the country. The corrupted and undeserving politicians and PMs shall be removed from their positions by replacing them with suitable and deserving candidates. There should be a revolution like the French Revolution in Nepal.

The next day, market reacted with a decrease of huge 145 points. But this was not the first time a leader has talked about market. From time to time, leaders speak about share market in Nepal. 

But, why do politicians speak about share market? There are good reasons, though!

1. Leaders from ruling party depict growing economy with the help of market increase.

2. Ruling party leaders promote their policies like monetary policy which impacts the market. Just promoting their policies. 

3. To gain public confidence by showing the increasing market. 

4. Don't want to give credit to single party and single person for the increase of market.

rv587w,"Understanding Corruption in Nepal: It's not politicians, its bureaucrats","Before you go ""Sabai muji politician ko galti ho"", remember this, the people that are in constant power regardless of the leadership in the past 25 years, most of my adulthood, and most of yours too are the bureaucrats. They have actually ruled the country, more than politicians.

Do you really think, a minister has the authority to sign papers for Engineering or accountancy or some technical field? It is always someone who has spent years studying, taking loans, travelling on buses. That person is inclined to always earn money fast. Politicians are like influencers, they are the scapegoats we point at and curse. But we never can curse the humble, educated, loksewa giving bureaucrats because god forbid if you question their judgement. LOKSEWA PASS GARERA PO AKO HOTA MUJI.

Not all bureaucrats are corrupt, some are. But all bureaucrats are inefficient. Inefficiency is as bad as corruption. There is so much bloating and redundancy. You want to change this country, you have to literally overhaul the Bureaucracy, their jobs are too secure. No incentive to work. Even if they reject every file at their office, they will get paid.

I am basically tired of people feeling like they done some shit, I have asked so many of my Uncles and Aunts what they accomplished in their government service and they have jack shit to convince me. A politician can be deposed in 5 years, these people can't be unless you have concrete evidence of wrongdoing, even then, the system will support in helping them survive.

If you want change, change bureaucratic service delivery, corruption will decrease from such an approach. Corruption alone is not the issue, its the inefficiency and bloating. What matters is quality of service we receive, I could really not bat an eye if they skim some profits off the top if the quality of service is top notch.

Prachande and Oli literally talking shit about each other and blaming each other made it not less than a typical Nepali TV Show. I was happy to see Balen, Sagar, and new leaders getting a platform for putting their thoughts out to millions of youths through podcasts.  Balen's podcast before he became mayor was really helpful for me to convince my parents on voting Balen. Why is Sanjay getting old politicians instead of new candidates sharing their thoughts at this election-time?

I was turning right toward lalitpur when i saw a police truck and Mercedes benz e class if I'm not wrong going at speed. I was shocked. It had a blue and red number plate and if I'm not wrong it must be for the use of politicans. Correct me if I'm wrong cause i don't know about the number plate here in Nepal. first of all why does a political need a $170k worth of sedan in a financially challenged country. If it was for president or even prime minister than i would be okay but why for just a politican and why do i see cars worth 70lakhs-1 cr just rusting around. I forgot which governmental office was that but it had 2 land Rover defender and a land cruiser multiple bikes having white and yellow number plates rusting and growing grass around it? Why do government has such expensive cars but neglects this beauties which are luxurious and can run for a 1mil miles.

nepali haru ek jana ko pani work ethics xaina, literally zero; atleast the people in this sub and the ones that i personally know, and they blame the country (ik our politicians are shit, but citizens are shittier).

try hard. if that doesn't work, try harder.. here's an inspiration, i'm living in nepal, i'm making 7-9 lakh per month; doing EVERYTHING legal. and i'm paying taxes for the shitty road i drive in, still not leaving this country. i want to do something here, and may be make a change someday. STAND THE F UP. if you're thinking of leaving the country, tell me what you've tried to do here, and how you failed, and how that was the country's fault? i know there are some genuine people who are fd by the govt, but whats your reason? did you even try?

vhebeu,A step-by-step guide to being a politician (Realistic Advice):,"One can compete and be elected for any post ranging from ward member to member of the parliament. The ranking, where you can be directly elected are as follows (federal to local):

1. Member of Parliament
2. Member of Provincial Assemblies
3. Mayor / Chairperson of Local Government
4. Deputy Mayor / Deputy Chairperson of Local Government
5. Ward Chairperson
6. Ward Members (Usually consists of two open members, one female member, and one Dalit female member). 

At the local level, one needs to be above 21 years old and not be convicted of any serious crimes.

For provincial and federal levels, one needs to be above 25 (35 in the case of the National Assembly). 

HOW CAN YOU MAKE AN ENTRY INTO POLITICS?

There are several ways to make an entry into politics. The majority of our politicians were either leader of the revolution or made entry through student unions.

ROUTE 1:

1. If you are dead serious about pursuing a career in politics and have big dreams to make it into the cabinet and maybe become PM, then the best way is to study on a government or public campus. 
2. I suggest you study subjects like engineering, law, journalism, or political science, and pick a student union of your choice. 
3. There are three major unions namely NSU (Congress), ANNFSU (NCP), and Akhil Krantikari (Maobadi). Pick anyone you like and become active within. 
4. Participate in meetings, do riots when there is a petrol hike or other stuff, help your college students, and NETWORK. Yes, networking is the most crucial aspect. 
5. The more people you know, the more people support you, and the higher your chances of climbing the ranks. 
6. This way, you get recognized and be visible to party leaders. 
7. Run for committee member posts afterward, and become chairperson or secretary-general of the student union of that cohort. 
8. Then you might get into the major national party and climb the ranks.
9. Get political tickets for MPA or MP. 
10. Become a minister, CM, or PM.

ROUTE 2:

1. If you don’t care much about being PM or CM, i.e. discharging executive duties, then it’s a bit easier than the first route. 
2. You could either join a party or run as an independent candidate here. To be a part of the executive body, however, requires support from parties, which doesn’t happen easily. 
3. Be a popular figure in your local area. Gain support from the public. Become a social worker. Participate in local events. Become a local celebrity. Jaha gaye pani sabaijana le jiu jiu namaskar vanne status huna paryo. 
4. Remember if you become popular, then the party will try to indoctrinate you into their party. It’s up to you at this point whether to continue the fight independent or 
5. Then, run for local elections. 
6. If you want to play it safe, then run for the ward member post. If you are highly ambitious, then run for mayor. 
7. Do good during the first tenure, so that people are obliged to elect you for your second term. 
8. At this point, you could retire from a political career if you’ve served as mayor for two terms. However, if you want to progress further then, you could attempt running from your area (constituency) for MPA or MP. 
9. However, even if you do get elected and set foot in the parliament, your chance of making it to the cabinet is next to impossible if you are an independent candidate. 

ROUTE 3:

1. You could be a career civil servant. Join administration, revenue, foreign, police force, or even military services. The minimum age for obtaining a pension is 20 years. After 20 years, you can declare early retirement and become a politician. 
2. You could join a party afterward or again run as an independent, depending on your goals and expectations from a political career. 
3. Become elected at any level.

ROUTE 4:

1. Become an expert in a field. Get a Ph.D., become an academic, scholar, or whatever it takes to become a specialist. 
2. Be the intellectual face of the party, and you might even get a chance to become a minister. 
3. This is considered a lateral entry.

ROUTE 5:

1. Be born into a rich political family.
2. No need to say more.

ROUTE 6:

1. Become a rich cunt.
2. Buy your way in.
3. Binod Chaudhary route. 

ROUTE 7:

1. Create a party of your own.
2. Need a lot of funding at the start.
3. Declare yourself party chairman, and gain support.
4. Unless you are a sensational person like Rabi Lamichhane, or any other popular figure, expect little support if any, at the start.
5. Work on expanding and making your party the national party. 

ONE THING YOU MUST REMEMBER IS,

The current top leaders, i.e. Sherey, Prachandey, and Oli, they were either revolutionary or were jailed during the Panchayat era. A situation like democracy being repealed and another revolution is far less likely. 

Hence, you need to have a primary career first before entering politics full-time. You need to be a successful businessman/woman, lawyer, journalist, writer, teacher, doctor, engineer, or whatever position and THEN make entry into politics. Not the other way around.

Good luck everyone, I hope to see some of you in a public office someday. I myself dream of being in one too. Jay Nepal.

uxj4l0,Are Youth Politicians(or any other) effective without laws like the Right to Recall and Jury Courts?/,"Balen Shah is a young boy who says I will do good(like other leaders said before they came into power).

If balen shah is good then why didn't he say that he supports the right to recall in him? According to him, he alone will solve all the problems in education, sanitation, roads, and all and all.  Let's say that there are 100 government schools in his area. How will he improve the education level in those schools? Many government schools are dying out.

According to me and my knowledge of politics, the best way to improve the condition of government schools and bring them in line with private schools we need right to recall district education officers and right to recall education ministers who will be directly elected by the people and people will have the right to remove them if they are not efficient. 

The district education officer will appoint the headmasters and other important posts in all government schools falling in his area. Then at the end of each academic year, the parents of the students studying and students will be given a paper to survey about the school and its quality of education. A passing score for the headmaster will be chosen. If he fails to gain that score he will be removed and another will be installed in his place by District Education Officer. 

Such things will ensure that the headmaster will work well. The school will have good labs, a library, buildings, transportation, and overall education will be improved. Teachers won't sleep in the class and there will be no beating of students. If nothing improves in a year or two years, then he/she will be recalled.

Has Balen Shah or any political leader of Nepal proposed any methods like this? If balen becomes the mayor will he look at all the 1000s government institutions by himself? Or is he just like Kp Oil, Lion Bahadur, and p0rnchanda?

iwz0aq,some people are stating reason for corruption as government employee & politician are not being paid well enough.,If that's the case what about private employees who are earning 20-25k after their bachelor at age of 24-25. The work in private sector is more of pressure in low salary compared to government's jobs.What are the alternatives for them except going abroad? Every individual would like to have house in Kathmandu rather than living in rent & have good standard of living not just politician & government employee. If government can work to provide employment opportunity & higher education opportunity outside valley there could be less competition for jobs in Kathmandu valley resulting more importance of employee.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/iwz0aq/some_people_are_stating_reason_for_corruption_as/,9/21/2020 11:59,17,0,10,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

jadjii,what kind of image do you have of the politicians that run the government in your head?,"my view:  


we all have an idea on the academic qualifications of the politicians which for most is as pathetic as it gets. how well do they understand english can be seen in their interviews. in my experience having a good grasp of english is imperative if you want to learn stuff because most good stuffs are written in english. books are the best way to learn stuff without having to waste time in learning lessons from the practical way of life. humans are a lot more sucessful than other animals because we could gather knowledge in the form of literature using the complexity of the language than can convey a lot of stuff that humans have learned throughout generations and man if theres not a ocean full of knowledge out there. well in the modern world their are mode medium other than books but books are still  very important.  


i have heard stuff like most of the communist politicans have read any book on communist ideology, i doubt that quite a few them even read any at all.  once heard kp oli scoffing at others mentioning that they dont read books and learn and suggesting that they need to learn more. i doubt about his efforts and feels like he is showing complacency. i sometimes hear interviews of politicians and  suprised by how how unimaginative  they really are. even experts in nepal are pseudo experts, crazy mfs. even my local politicians keep sharing those click baity stuff make be pseudo journalist on fb.  well its a fack that quite a lot of the politicians have grown in lack of any form of proper education. local way of life and ideas are starkly slammed into their mindset, which is a shame cause we are living at the remotest and most underdeveloped corner in the world. some places in the world in contrast to our nation have progessed  light years ahead of us. i just think it is imperative to learn about their sucesses and then project that to out society because theres alot a lot to learn, people preached about democracy back in the old revolution days but how many did really know about it, how it started it the greece, or its development since then. they weres mostly young dalits kids looking for oppourtunity misguided my criminals. fight for democracy was just a name given to legitimize the movement which many didnt understodd even the leaders.  how many did they tunned into the millenia long debate on socalism vs capitalism theres a lot a stuff written about it learned thorough millenia of human experience that mean among many other things are like a basic common knowlege a leader of a country should have.    


  
what do i think about these politicans i think most of them  are just superstitious under informed boomers not much different then my father.  but the worst part is not that the worst part is they are complacent arrogent personalities who will not put any effort to learn new stuff, some examples to why i believe such because i just heard one boasting about how ingenious the idea to other structures other then hospitals for quarantine was, these mfs say it took them 2 years just to adjust their mindset to federalism. their plans seems to be we know nothing but we will learn and make it work which i doubt very much. nobody cares to ask for their detailed plans and policy before electing them just using demagogeury seems to work. its even worse for nepal because other countries has strong agencies a lot of smart manpower focused to run the country politicans are just ponting them. putin used to say "" america is run by black men in suits president will change but their policies would nt"" nepal lack anything of that sort instead theres need of ambitious visionary person will a plan to build such organizational structures from the ground. which definitely isnt happening in nepal.  


not to mention the criminal culture. worst people become politcians even my cousin want to be some sort  of officer her says he will earn a lot of money thorough bribe. i hear some saying they are masterminds but i think its just like my mom saying "" any one who is a extrovent and is chackchake and dherai kura garni "" as batho and "" intovert who dont talk much or dont engage in childish misbehaviour"" as lato

Now I'm not saying that as soon as sm1 hits the 60 mark, they should be discarded and put in retirement homes.. But maybe having them around as advisors might be in everyones best interest.

18s1mc9,Mindset Of Nepali People," 

Yesterday someone posted something along the lines of ""Nepal is the poorest country......"". And I made a somewhat positive comment about the country ani sabbb jana replies ma, ma mathi khanina ayo lol.

**First of all IDGAF about politics or any political party I am just saying what I feel.**

I know that Nepal is a poor country. I know most of politicians worry much more about themselves then the country, I know Prachande is definitely not a great PM, I know there is a huge problem of brain drain, I know that the roads and other infrastructures are not good, I know people don't live the most comfortable life. I know the youth are frustrated.

If you always look for fault you will always find it. See how far we have come. Nepal ma technological advancement ekdum fast rate ma vai raxa. People are getting aware about education, health, equality and everything. Timi haru dherai jana lai tha nai xaina nepal kasto theo. I assume most of you are from the city side. I was born in village, ma janmeko aggilo dina mero mummy le bari ma kam garnu pareko rey.(Imagine 9 month pregnant woman working on field) . 0 awareness theo manxe ma. And now whenever I go to my village, I see change. Progress is not something measured by comparing to others. It is very easy to look at the west and be like ""Wow tini haru ko rode dammi xa, tini haru ko infrastructure dammi xa, hamro ma sab neta harami xan"". First look hami kaha theam aila kaha ayam.

Try to have a little positive attitude. I know, I very much know about all the problems, but there is nothing you can do about it my whining about it on reddit. Sab jana hya jo youth bidesh gako complain garxa, tini haru ni either visa reject vara basexa ya ta paxi jane plan garexa. Jo jo le neta kharab vako complain garxa, tini haru le nai election ma masu vat khara vote dina janxa. No one give a flying fk about this country, sab lai bidesh jana xa, tara complain garna ta koi paxi hatne haina. Change starts from within. Educate gara ghar pariwar , xar ximeki lai, spread awareness, contribute something for the country, do something, rather then complaining about everything.

Ani on a personal note, I really don't get the people who advocate for Monarchy. Please enlighten me how is it better to hand all the power to One person (and then he hands his power to his son and it goes on forever) rather then general people being able to elect their leaders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18s1mc9/mindset_of_nepali_people/,12/27/2023 14:14,117,0,109,Roman & English,0,0,1,1,0,0

1gd2ns0,A Revolution is Needed in Kathmandu Valley's Public Transportation System,"If you’re someone who uses public transport daily in Kathmandu, you know exactly what I'm talking about, it’s frustrating. I mostly travel by bus, and it’s often the worst part of my day. Rarely do you find a non-packed bus. Now, with winter approaching, it’s going to get dark earlier, and after 7 p.m., buses become almost impossible to find. Even in summer, it’s hard to get a bus after 7, and winter makes it even tougher. We call Ktm and Capital City but it get shut down after 8 pm. 

Then there are issues like inconsistent schedules, rude conductors, fare disputes, harassment of female passengers, pickpocketing, and unhygienic conditions. We’ve all experienced it.

Recently, I was in Delhi, where I had to travel a lot, and the Metro made my journeys so much easier. I kept thinking how amazing it would be to have something similar in Kathmandu. I traveled to different stations, some even 10 km away, and it was so quick, and the fares weren’t too expensive. The best part was how quickly the trains arrived, one after another. Sure, it’s Delhi, so it was crowded during peak hours, but it was still far better than being packed into a bus.

Now, I get that we can’t have a Metro in Kathmandu right away. There’s been talk about how underground tunnels are possible, but they’d cost a lot and take yearssss to complete. I’m not asking for a Metro, but we do need something. Even improving our current bus system would make a huge difference. It’s way more affordable and achievable than building a Metro.

Before every election, politicians promise that public transport is the future, that mass transit will reduce traffic. But once they’re in office, nothing gets addressed. A simple survey on daily passenger numbers, busy areas, and the number of buses required could solve this issue. I rember Balen said before election that we need to bring every public tranport under the same umbrella organization in order to improve it, which was nice, but Idk how's the progress on it.  I know the transport union holds a lot of power. There was a good article (by Ukaalo or Ukera, I can’t remember) about Nepal Yatayat’s monopoly on its routes Those small Nepal Yatayat buses waste road space, but they’re untouchable. There was a city Metro Yatayat a few years back, but it was pulled off the route after a few months. It;s the same story in every route. We have Sajha Yatayat, but the buses are too few, so they get packed quickly. 

This is just my rant about the frustrating state of public transport in Kathmandu. If you don’t own a private vehicle, I’m sure you can relate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1gd2ns0/a_revolution_is_needed_in_kathmandu_valleys/,10/27/2024 4:02,113,0,48,English,0,1,1,0,0,2
1finuyg,Why Balen Won the Mayoral Race in Kathmandu ?,"The election of Balen Shah as the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City should serve as a wake-up call for the established political parties. The fact that a young independent candidate, with no prior political experience, managed to win in the stronghold of the two largest political parties—the UML and Congress—clearly signals widespread public discontent with the political status quo.

For years, these traditional parties have been stuck in a cycle of repeating the same promises, with little to no change. The voters, especially the youth, are tired of hearing the same old rhetoric with no substantial results. Balen’s victory is a direct outcome of this frustration. Unlike the career politicians, Balen hasn’t made grand speeches—he’s simply shown his work through action, and that’s what resonates with people.

The growing support for Balen, both from those in the country and those abroad, is proof of the fact that people, particularly the younger generation, are looking for change. They are inspired by his dedication and practical approach to governance. If the political parties had been more attentive to the needs and desires of the people, Balen’s rise wouldn’t have been so sudden or necessary.

Yet, instead of supporting a young leader who has come forward to improve the city, traditional parties are actively trying to demotivate him. Why is this? Shouldn't the improvement of Kathmandu be something that benefits everyone? The Prime Minister and other top leaders should focus on policy-making and addressing the needs of the people rather than making petty remarks against Balen.

It’s time for the top political leaders to set aside their egos and start working for the people, or they risk becoming irrelevant in a political landscape that is clearly changing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1finuyg/why_balen_won_the_mayoral_race_in_kathmandu/,9/17/2024 2:47,70,0,62,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

12mkh7v,Can someone genuinely and nicely explain to me the fascination with Rabi?,"I had responded to a comment earlier on a post about this. But I wanted to open it up as a post to get some thoughts. I wanted to have a nice discussion regarding this issue, as I feel let down by Rabi.

For context, I live in the US and came here for college from Nepal. In the beginning, I genuinely was supporting him as it seemed like the change we needed, but it's like ""jun jogi aye ni kanei chireko"".

He seems like any other politician, **money/power hungry and seems like a narcissist** (based on his presentation at the press conference). He really doesn't have an educational background required in 2023 to be leading a country (he's only obtained a degree up to grade 12). He came to the US to further his career, but he worked at a **Subway Restaurant as a food handler**, which is the most basic entry-level position in the US. Moreover, he **fled the US by maxing out his credit cards** on Discover and Amex to the tune of around $30K USD!! He has **active legal cases filed against him in the US**. Financial Fraud?  I just think he **doesn't have the technical skills to be leading a country**. I can't imagine him being able to stand up for himself in front of other world leaders.

In terms of politics, I was very hopeful when 22MPs were elected (direct/proportional). It soon turned to disappointment when I saw the selection for the Ministers. He **chose DPM with Home, which is merely a power ministry** and he was the one who championed that there were too many DPMs in Nepal. Why not make a stand yourself? He **should have chosen one of the development ministries** to actually have made an impact. The **Labor Minister was a manpower agent, conflict of interest?** And finally, to be inclusive I guess they **gave 1 female the position of State Minister, which is basically a joke in Nepal made to satisfy quotas** within a faction (goot) with no real power. At least, 1 woman should have been made a Minister, not a State Minister.

Also, when he was Minister, **he fast-tracked a tender to 7 days and the tender only had 1 bid**!!! This is how it's been happening for ages. Fastrack a tender and 1 bid from the company paying you under the table. No wonder he chose Home! **His response was that they made him sign it on the day of swearing-in**. Are we really going to buy that? **Where is the due diligence on his part** to figure out what he was passing? Esto hawadari guff dera ani hami janatale thikai cha bhanne feri?

Recently, a **tape came out between Dhaka and Prasai implicating Rabi in a corruption deal** for 2 crores. As an informed citizen, do you really think Dhaka would just go around asking for 2crores without the party actually having requested it? Overall Rabi **seems like a conman** to me. RSP is a great **party with some very talented leaders led by a joker**.

Can someone explain why you still have hope from him? Why not push for another leader within the RSP with a proper and undisputed background?

Edit1: Kinda disappointed this is being voted down, wanted to have a discussion. But I want to make it clear, I do support the party albeit I am disenchanted by the leader and I wish it was led by people like Sumana Shrestha, Arnico Pandey or Swarnim Wagle. Outside the party, I admire Gagan Thapa for his track record and passion, given he gave up going to the US to study to fight against the king and the hegemony of bahun/chhetris in nepal.

Edit2: He claims he was a manager at his subway chain, so I apologize for getting that wrong. But I highly doubt it as he would probably not be racking up massive credit card debt on his salary.

Edit3: Additionally, he received a foreclosure notice on his home in Texas for not paying his mortgage. He left his ex-wife and kid there, where is the support for his kid?? This dude seems like a genuine sociopath to me.

Edit4: Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts in a very polite way, I have a better understanding of why people support Rabi. I don't think anyone was able to convince me personally, but I do see your guy's viewpoint. It seems like at this point, it doesn't really matter about what he has done, his character, or his background. Reminds me of the movie ""Rango"", it's more hope than anything else. Let's not forget, people have different ways of thinking and we are not all the same, we should respect people regardless of their preference for politics. Hopefully, things turn out better as we have basically lost the next 5 years.

there was a new Operation planned for early morning today but due to some emergency case it has to be shifted to late evening. There was also some set back during the procedure as well and my colleague were handling those and these sort of situation is normal.  
I happen to walk by the theatre during that time(I'm not a surgeon). There's the visitor of the patient shouting that why my patient's procedures is being delayed, is there any fowl play here? I will burn this hospital down if something happens, or I will call all the journalists. he was shouting in loud voice. The patient is okay, case was simply delayed due to some unavailability of instruments and it was solved quickly. I don't know why he shouted, and I couldn't understand that after he threatened us that we will give him the best treatment available?that isn't going to happen.

I felt so demoralising listening those words. We are managing such complicated cases in such rural area with minimal fees atleast you all couldn't praise, please don't demoralise us. People are taking us as for granted.

Late night, We are talking about the changed situation here and now we decided to cut down our services. Let them take their patient to some big cities and let them suffer. We are done. Nepali don't deserve the care and affection we gave them.
And I will be out of the country in few months.
We are stupid, we are idiots. We are to blame, Politicians are just taking advantage of us.

1flucfe,Begging issues of kathmandu,"I saw a post related to this and was gonna comment there, but I realised my observation might be worth a post than a comment. Here it goes.

Begging issues of ktm - 

Trans haru le harrass garne (don’t even speak nepali)

Sano baccha bokera tantalapur ghaam ma magdai hidne (and the ones I’ve met can’t even speak nepali)

I have lived in ktm for 25 yrs. I have lived in koteshwor for 20+ years. I have roamed koteshwor as a teenage and young adult for 10+ years. And I’ve only started seeing these events since the past 4-5 years. It’s very new. The trans thing is like 1-2 years old whereas the indian with the child beggar is 5 yrs although it was common in gaushala area. 

Once I calculated how much a beggar could earn when I saw one getting money in thamel area. The woman, highly likely of indian origin or of nepali origin yet had lack of nepali speaking skills, asked money during a traffic jam in front of garden of dreams. In 5 minutes, almost 10 people gave her money. Considering the smallest currency in notes is 5 rupees, let’s assume ten people gave her five rupees over the course of five minutes making her income 50 rupees. Let’s assume there is 5 minutes of jam and five minutes of free traffic(half of the time is jam and half of the time is free traffic), so we can say she would have a total of 30 minutes of begging per hour which is 6 sessions of 5 minutes per hour. 

Her hourly income = 6* her 5 minute rate which is 50. So, ultimately 300 rs/hr. (I as a doctor, have earned between 130-180 rs/hr). Her monthly income would be, if she worked 10 hrs a day for 6 days a week (assuming 4 weeks a month) to be - days in month * hours worked in a day * pay per hour = 30 * 10 * 300 = 90000. 

Can you imagine that?

I worked for 12 hrs/ day, everyday except for two holdays for month to earn 50000/month, as a doctor. And some beggar earns that?

It shouldn’t be possible. So I concluded there is some higher gundagardi that makes these humans work as employees to earn momey and provide them with salary. Because there is no way a person with such sub standard way of living would be making 90000 a month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1flucfe/begging_issues_of_kathmandu/,9/21/2024 3:49,42,0,57,English and Roman Nepali Mixed,0,1,1,0,0,2

vf0m7j,Why are we ok with the government taxing us up to 200% on vehicles?,"I mean if the roads were flawless and had smooth asphalt I'd be pretty ok about that. But most of our roads has the texture of the moon. And also they have the audacity to fine if we put on a sticker on our bikes. Bike modification should be made legal minus the loud exhaust and mirrors. Also there should be new system for the traffic checking. Random checking should be abandoned. It just slows down the traffic and defeats the whole point of reliability of a private vehicle. Also keeping  the blue book by the traffic is absolute horrendous. If you want us to pay the fine, make and database where it registers all the activities of the driver. Confiscating registration is both hassle for the traffic and the rider imo.

194qeo8,Nepal: Asal Hindustan,"Prithvi Narayan Shah (Happy birthday), the founding father of this nation, had envisioned his land for Hindus and declared it Asal Hindustan. However, it was later named Nepal, which I think is disrespectful to our Lord King PNS. 

Turkey recently changed their name to Turkiye. India is trying to change theirs to Bharat. We should change ours to  Federal Democratic Monarchy of Asal Hindustan, or Asal Hindustan in short or Hindustan in shortest. There are many benefits to the name change. It will ensure our sovereignty forever. The greatest threat to our nation is India.  Either from their politicians or from Hinduvta (very different from Hinduism). All of them think we are part of India. So if we change our name to Asal Hindustan, we would seen as the the main-land of Hindus and India (or Bharat) as part of Asal Hindustan. Hindustan can't be Bharat, but Bharat can be Hindustan. When Indians say Hindustan zindabad or Jai Hind, they will be praising us. 

Political movement for the restoration of Hinduism and Monarchy is increasing day by day. Changing the name of Nepal will ensure that the mistakes of 07/08 are never repeated. It's also a fitting name for Shah Monarchy 2.0.

Happy birthday, King.

10wlaae,Conspiracy Theory: Nepalese Cartel,"There are approximately 10 to 15 families in Nepal who hold multiple citizenships and are believed to control everything in the country, including banks, trading agencies, stock brokers, food chains, hospitals, media houses, airport services, manpower agencies, and security contracts. 

These families either own these entities or hold a significant portion of their shares and operate as a cartel, eliminating competition through hostile takeovers or financial means by starving out the competition.

They are reportedly devoid of compassion for their fellow Nepalese and it is doubted that they even keep their wealth in the country. Also, they have most of the high profile politicians in their pockets. Even politicians are afraid to speak about them.

Their ownership of banks allows them to secure any amount of loans at any time with minimal interest rates. Also, the country's budget is always designed in a way that they're the ones who're benefitted. 

This is merely a conspiracy theory from my perspective. In my opinion, the only institution that has not recently yielded to these families is the Nepal Rastra Bank.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/10wlaae/conspiracy_theory_nepalese_cartel/,2/8/2023 2:53,143,0,76,English,1,1,0,0,0,2

Feed ma pros ra cons authyo ra we ourselves could decide what is wrong or not, information verify garna ni garo hunna thyo. After Tiktok has been banned, most users will return back to facebook which is very alarming cus Facebook is very suspicious for selling monotonous single sided propagandas. RONB ra Balen ko jodi ta euta mass *gaslighting* ko example matra ho, bhitra bhitrei dherei kura can be manipulated. Through tiktok, Neta harko chaal chalan and their questionable/selfish decisions have been shared and heard. Tiktok with its one minute watch was a genuine/quick withdraw from primitive news sources. After TikTok, I'd actually not be surprised if 'they' attacked channels like 'The Nepali Comment', 'In depth Story', 'Project Kura', etc. TikTok ban hannu is just a show case for the grown ups to flex their power hammer against the Youths. Banning TikTok and letting the geezers win was a massive blow for us who are waiting for change in politics. TikTok was the one of the best cards we youth had against these power players.

Facebook hard nails popular pages like 'RONB' and others on our feed, which makes it really easy for the rich to manipulate what's heard and what's not. It's very easy to bribe a single page, while TikTok can't disappoint us with it's ever changing channels and feed. Main handle we lost is the '**Reach'**. Through tiktok famous upcoming channels and entrepreneurs like YouTube channels, Youth politicians will have to primitively advertise themselves which will cause a massive roadblock. Many Youth Politicians and quality YouTube channels do not have enough finance to compete with the oligarchs. Let's try not bringing obvious TikTok cons into this, alikati common sense bhayeko youth don't do anything that performs 'sanskriti bikriti'. And yes 'Sanskriti bikriti' is the major reason for banning tiktok, which in my opinion is obviously not the case.

We had a way of letting our voices be heard even to the aunties, the uncles, the grandpas, almost the entire nation. And now we're losing it/lost it. Ani yes realistically bhanda we can't do a single thing against it except for venting in Reddit. So, yo perspective bata sochda what do u guys think?

1f8vu3b,Deepfakes and Victimization of women,"I wanna share what has been going on in South Korea relating to Deepfake crimes: 

South Korean women in the last few weeks have been outraged and asking for help from women around the world to pressure their government for strict regulations against Deepfakes. 

S.Korean women discovered an entire Deepfake porn and Child pornography ring on Telegram with youngest victims being elementary school girls (5-6 years old). The telegram chatrooms with names: Mother room, Sister room etc. were found. Female Teachers, classmates, military personnel were also victimized by creating deepfaked videos using pictures from their social media, student yearbook photos. Some women came out stating that their brothers and fathers secretly took pictures of them when they were sleeping, bathing. They were groped in their sleep and these pictures circulated in the Telegram chats for more deepfakes. The chatroom users estimated to be more than 200,000 people. 

To enter the chatroom, a person would have to provide pictures of their female acquaintance along with their name, address, student id for deepfake videos to be made about them. And the most shocking part is that it seems about 70% of these chatroom users are teenager boys upto age 19. For more detailed look, check out Rotten Mango’s podcast on Spotify on this case. 

The perpetrators seem very confident that they will not be caught. The politicians in S.Korea’s reaction to this has been just “Boys will be boys. Just hysterical women making a big deal out of nothing”. The regulations against these crimes are basically nom-existent Which is why Korean women took to twitter to ask help from international communities to talk and share about this. 

I wanted to prompt a discussion regarding rising misuse of AI, deepfakes and what regulations and restrictions could be put in place to prevent victimization of women and men before it is too late. What reforms should be made in Nepal as well?? What actions should we take as a person and as a nation to minimize blatant exploitation of AI?? Can we even do anything??

18fjem0,NCell did nothing wrong. NCell is a victim,"I don't understand why people are after NCell. What NCell did was nothing wrong. In fact, NCell (Axiata) faced national-level bullying. Back then, NCell was controlled by a Norwegian company. They didn't directly invest in NCell; they invested through a holding company (Reynolds Holding Ltd.) based in a tax-haven country. Axiata took over NCell by purchasing Reynolds Holding Ltd. Capital gain tax is paid by the seller; however, Axiata was forced to pay the capital gain tax (1). This is like, you purchased a share in NEPSE for Rs 200, and instead of the seller, you are forced to pay the tax. While NCell is labelled as tax evader, they are one of the higest tax payer in Nepal.

**Now let's look at the current situation.**

Axiata decides to exit. Suddenly, people are butt-mad. Some even filed a writ order against NCell to stop sales. Well, this is beyond the jurisdiction of the Nepali government or even the constitution. An entity is free to sell its assets. Again, this takeover isn't happening in Nepal. The 80% sale is happening through that holding company (Reynolds Holding Ltd.). And the Nepali government cannot stop sales or purchases. I wonder how no one even understands this. And is filing the case for cheap populairty.

**NCell Valuation**

NCell was sold for 6arba something. Many call it dirt cheap. Some politicians even came forward and said the government should buy it or IPO it. I wonder how even these politicians are not aware that, as per the agreement, after 25 years (which is 6 years from now), all Renold Holding assets will be transferred to the Nepali government. If Axiata sells their holding today, they get 6 arba. If Axiata holds, after six years they will get 0 and all their holdings will be transferred to the government. What would they choose? 6Arab or 0? The current buyer has 6 years to recover their investment.

Their operating income was 57,102 million back in 2017; as of 2023, it is 37,442 million. And it is estimated to go lower, not only in Nepal but also globally (3) (4).

After 6 years Nepal Government will have absolute monopoly in telecom, they might even merge NCell with NTC.

There are bigger issue like bhutani sarnarthi, 100kg sunkanda, tea estate kanda which makes NCell amount look peanuts.

This is the reason foreign companies doesn't want to invest in Nepal. Nepal has higest corporate tax rate and red tapes everywhere. On the other hand, neighbouring countries are giving tax discounts for FDI.

18xga18,Nepalese society,"Nepalese people always tend to blame politicians and the government for the lack of development. They want their rights but don't want to fulfill their duties. Am I saying we shouldn't demand our rights? No. We should. But we should also perform our duties as citizens 

1. Honesty : Nepalese people need to be honest with everything; their work, actions. The officials need to come to office at 9:45 am so that they can honestly start serving the people from 10 am sharp. The local people should honestly refrain from throwing garbage onto the road. The people should honestly follow the traffic rules even if it is a galli or if there is no traffic police present. The people at authority should honestly acknowledge their shortcoming and try to improve them.

2. Clarity : We have seen emergence of new faces in politics in the past two years, with the rise of Balen Shah, RSP, Harka Sampang. But what I feel the Nepalese people lack is clarity. It is perfectly okay to support a person or a political ideology. But it is also equally important to respect other's ideology. People either support Balen or RSP or Rabi completely or degrade them and hate them completely. Some goes for other political parties as well. Very few people really analyse the work. Support when they have done a good job and protest when they've done something bad. And this is not only in case of politics. Nepalese people don't know how to respect other's opinion. They need to learn that it is okay to have a difference of opinion and it is okay to agree to disagree.

Its fine If he just wanted to be mayor of Dhahran on next term as BC make just 16% of Dhahran population but if he want success of national politics than triggering certain community and faith is not helpful.

16abe03,"On: why the rule that “government employees are not allowed to use public vehicles assigned to them"" is a bad rule!","On: why the rule that “government employees are not allowed to use public vehicles assigned to them as a part of their position” is a bad rule!

We need to first understand that Nepal is transportation starved! What this means is that not everyone that needs or could achieve more with adequate transportation has access to transportation. Bikes are marked up 250%—with the government taking most of your bike before it even gets to you. This means the price does not reflect demand. Not everyone that wants and or needs a bike or car is not able to afford one.

Given this reality, let’s analyze the current situation. We know public employers are corrupt and as a society we have a rule in place that checks their powers in hopes of preventing them from abusing their powers and privileges. One check is this vehicle use rule. We are limiting their powers to limit abuse of power. We believe, in a transportation starved nation, that these people should not abuse their vehicles. 

This policy has good intentions but awful consequences. Anyone reading this, I want you to brainstorm answers to this question. What abuse could be so great that government employees must be stopped from using vehicles they have access to at their full convenience? Do we believe that a politician going on holiday in their government car—given the petrol is paid for out of their pocket—is such a detriment to the country? 

That must be the case if we are to continue enforcing this rule. There are many consequences of this rule. Namely, this locks up vehicles from being traded and used in the open market. These politicians will likely own their own private vehicles which they purchased prior to getting to office. So when they are given a government vehicle that they can only use on some days, they are forced to keep their private vehicle. 

These people are in power for a long time—with the term limits for many elected positions being for five years. The current vehicle use policy binds them to owning two vehicles. Any vehicle that has already passed customs and inside the country is worth a lot more than if it exists outside the country in international markets. That’s why Nepal has a lot of very old vehicles still on the road. It would be very costly to replace these vehicles despite them not functioning optimally. When we force a politician to keep their own cars on top of a government owned vehicle, we prevent a bike or a car from going to someone who needs it. 

If this policy were not in existence, someone like Balen would perhaps opt to sell their privately owned vehicle for they won’t need it for five years. This is likely to happen because unless anyone has to, they would not like to pay maintenance for a car or bike that is not of use to them. If Balen was freely allowed to use the Mayor’s car for any use, he would sell his own car! This car could and would be sold and used by a family who desperately needs one! It would free up vehicles from every government employee. These people can easily buy another one five years down the line! 

So, I ask fellow Nepalis, are the downsides of politicians using their public vehicles for private purposes so great that we continue this transportation famine we have been facing since day one? Do we not owe the nation to make rational decisions and abolish this rule so that it’s not just politicians hoarding vehicles? We are hungry for vehicles and we ourselves are preventing vehicles from going towards hungry folks!

u8bkqk,Explanation of Nepal's Current Economy,"The current economic crisis has many contributing factors, which politicians have refused to explain, that it is the design of the system than some flaw caused by the pandemic.

1.) Remittance based economy - The government since the end of the civil war, has been able to use the rapid influx of remittance, to make up for the fact they don't actually have a viable economic plan.

Remittance have allowed Nepal to switch from consumption of domestic goods, to relying heavily on Indian and other foreign imports. This inflow of foreign currency was halted during the pandemic, but is merely an instigator, and not indicative of the actual fundamental problem with the economy.

(https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=NP)

2.) Credit Crunch - All of this cash coming from abroad, increased spending in the economy, as well as savings. Which allowed banks to loan it out as cheap credit, however many people relied on the fact that, they will always have an influx of foreign income in order to pay it off.

So when the pandemic inevitably hit, many of these people were not able to go abroad, and many host nations themselves were in lockdown.

As a result, people have been eating into their savings and are now finding themselves unable to pay back their debts. This reduces the total credit the banks can loan to people and businesses, and causes a slump in the economy, and reduces the rate of recovery from Covid.

(https://english.onlinekhabar.com/liquidity-crunch-where-money.html)
(https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2021/11/08/liquidity-crunch-and-low-capital-expenditure)

3.) Neoliberal Policies - The choice to open the nation completely to Indian and foreign goods, instead of boosting domestic productions, is an intentional choice by all those in government these past 10 years.

Indian agriculture has completely wiped out Nepali farmers, as it has a massive scale in production, whilst enjoying large government subsidies on fertilisers, as well as a Minimum Support Price. 

All of this, in a country that is still majority agrarian.

But why is this? Because capital needs new market, and will use any method to achieve it. Our leaders have understood that they will get the backing of New Delhi, if they remain the same on economic policy towards Indian businesses.

Think of how nothing has fundamentally changed in economic policy wise, from Baburam, Prachanda, Madhav, Oli, Sushil Koirala or Deuba. They might talk about buying Nepali, whilst the average Nepali will just buy the cheapest goods, for survival.

(http://southasiajournal.net/nepals-dependency-and-underdevelopment-a-challenge-to-national-security/)

4.) Failure to have an independent Central Bank - The recent firing of the Central Bank's Governor, gives an insight into the problem.

Monetary Policy from the bank needs to be independent from party politics. Otherwise we see what happened in Turkey, where President Erdogan's push for low interest rates, in line with Islamist and Populist rhetoric have plunged their currency into crisis.

The Central Bank needs to be able to prioritise long term health of the economy, over short term political gains for the current party in power.

What I forsee in the short term:

1.) Right now, the Nepali government has been given grants and aid, from the US and the World Bank. 

Total of around 809 Million USD, but this would be paid out over 5 years, and would only allow for 1 month of Foreign Reserves max (1 Month - 1.6 Billion USD).

This will still not be enough to avert significant harm to average Nepali. Especially ones with children, the impoverished and the elderly. As Price of food and gas continues to rise.

(https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/amp/us-agrees-to-provide-additional-rs-80-billion-grant-in-five-years-to-nepal/news.html.twig)

2.) In addition, with the War in Ukraine, causing Ukrainian agriculture production to plummet, and Russia threatening to cut off their own stocks; this is now causing food prices to rise worldwide.

Whilst this is manageable for countries with large state apparatuses, which can afford to subsidise food prices, Nepal and other developing countries cannot afford to do the same.

If you are a Nepali farmer, then this is a good time for business as you can sell at competitive prices with India for the first time.

Long Term:

1.) As more and more people go abroad, and settle there, there will eventually be fewer and fewer remittance coming in.

See how the Indian and Pakistani Diaspora in the UK or the US, eventually completely lose ties to their ethnic origins, and become completely invested in where they or their children were born.

This is coupled with disinheriting Nepalis with dual citizenship, which further disconnects future generations from their ethnic homeland, reducing the remittance and tourism inflow even more.

All of this combines into the worst case scenario, where we still cannot escape LLDC status by 2030 as was the target, as we simply don't have the productive people left.

2.) Complete destruction of domestic production, if the government continues to have neoliberal trade policies, allowing Indian government subsidised goods flood our markets without restriction.

Instead of boosting domestic production, our leaders have allowed India to exploit this agrarian nation, and it is on purpose, as India will not support any Prime Minister's government, that wishes to do carve an independent trade policy.

The closest example of this, would be in Angola, where food is still imported across vast distances, at exorbitant prices due to very little money spent on post-civil war production recovery.

3.) Slipping further towards into a debt ridden state, much like Pakistan and the IMF. Where economic mismanagement and corruption, leads to unbreakable cycles of austerity laden bailouts.

Whilst the West eagerly sits by to implement neoliberal policies and austerity, whenever a bailout is required from the IMF.

This is the current trajectory of Nepal, and it will remain so unless we can break out of this within the next 10 to 15 years.

Not to mention all of this will cause instability, and push the people to take up violence, much like the economic slump post Jana Andolan 1990's economic rise.

But in Nepal, darshak are mostly unemployed. They can buy such tickets to see the entertainment and these people don't even try to get the job and don't want to work either.

No , its not  Neil Armstrong, its not Albert Einstein . Its Rama and Krishna, the fictional characters whom these society holds as moral epitome . Instead of portraying them as  fictional characters, we are taught they are real, they are our saviors.  This affects us psychologically , we happily concede that Ravana  had a "" Puspak Biman "" invented before the modern science and make it our pride, but embrace  and defend the conspiracy theories if human ever reached the moon . The other route of glorifying and embracing ""pseudo-scientific "" heroes lead us to believe in one true savior to our every problem . No we don't need better  institutions , we need a ""avatar"" , that will come and protect us and free all of us from our problems, with our least effort.

2. We thus slowly become  victims of these "" pseudo-nuances "" subconsciously . We start to doubt our rationality, our knowledge and ability to comprehend. We ,now, have no hesitations to go to "" jyotish baba"" and pay Rs 500 to him for the solution to our  every problems , to Ayurveda crooks who claims to cure virus with herbal antibiotics. We reject the 70% effectiveness of the vaccines , because we need 100% , because 100% effective is ""pseudo-science "" which we have fallen in love with.

3. Enter now the politicians who will greatly exploit our fond of ""pseudo-nuances"" . They will make bold claims about solving every problems with 100% guarantee because we know this is what we are comfortable with. We don't ask  them how would they increase the GDP, how would they increase the per capita income and by how much, how would they increase the per capita energy consumption by x amount in y amount of time . Because this is science and science for us is extremely uncomfortable . We need to feel good, we need to be told not to worry, we need to be told we have a savior .

4. If we really want to evolve as a country , there isn't going to be a quick fix , at least  not in our generation time  , anyone who says will fix everything and you believe that you've already fallen in the trap of "" pseudo-nuance"" but  this is going to be a long run. But we can start  ,we have to start otherwise the next generation is going to fall in the same trap as we did.

vi1f56,We should ban cars.,"I had a previous post about how high is our taxes on vehicles and how it's a lame excuse for politicians to fill their swiss bank. It soon got in a heated argument in the comments(I apologize for being a immature piece of shit) and I've read through all the comments. 

Now I came to a conclusion that we should just ban cars.
I mean cars take up huge space, petrol, pollution stuff like that. I don't mean in any way to personally order a car owner that they can't own a car. Or raise taxes until its unaffordable, trust me, nothing is gonna stop the riches to buy cars even at unreasonable price.
 Many roads built give priorities to cars. How about we give priorities to cyclists and public buses? How about we narrow the roads and built parks nearby? Make the life of cars very difficult. Ban cars on some streets, or restrict cars from parking at the side of the road or charge them for parking in public.

Raising the taxes is the most inefficient way to demotivate the people to buy cars or any vehicle. Also sorry the baity title. I didn't mean total ban on cars. Just throttle the use and reliability of a car so people move to another mode of transport. Bikes, Cycle, Bus or walks. Skateboard and scooters too.
And for the people with cars or car owners. You don't have to worry about how much money you wasted buying a car. Rules above is only focused for the busiest streets of ktm or any other place.

But if any of our KMC vehicles are stopped by the government from tomorrow, I will set the Singha Durbar on fire. Remember, thief government,” Shah posted on the social media Saturday night itself threatening to torch the administrative center of the federal government.

Kasto immature ho yo manche? His an adult and politician why does he talk like this ? His ego seems out of control. I think his political career isn’t going to go ver well because of incidents like this. The police said they stopped the car for 1 or 2 minutes and I believe them. His acting like his some revolutionary that the evil government is after. Bro I stopped vendors from selling on road and that’s it. He doesn’t have the balls or brain to take on the powerful real estate industry that has made Kathmandu land unaffordable he bullied some poor people and yelled at people for not making parking.

1fl2xyt,Nirmala Kurmi Case are you aware of this news?,"The Ruby Khan-led Mahila Adhikar Manch—literally, women’s rights forum—has filed a complaint against Banke police and the district attorney at the National Human Rights Commission for their reluctance to lodge cases against Nepali Congress leader Badshah Kurmi.

Forteeen protesters have been staging a sit-in at Maitighar in Kathmandu since August 9, demanding Badshah be sacked as a minister from the Lumbini provincial government and lodging a case against him in Banke district court. Though he stepped down as a minister last week following the protest, no cases have been filed against him.

Badshah, a Nepali Congress leader and Lumbini provincial assembly member, is the prime accused in Nirmala Kurmi’s disappearance and capture of her property. Nirmala, a resident of Banke district, disappeared mysteriously in 2010 and remains missing.

“The chief of Banke police and the district attorney have been creating obstacles for justice by not filing a court case in Nirmala Kurmi's case,” reads the complaint filed by the Manch, urging the commission to take action against them.

Banke-based human rights activists have been staging protests regularly for 42 days, demanding to proceed to legal action against the Congress leader. “Badshah had to resign following our protest,” Khan said. “We will not give up unless the case against him reaches the court.”

The protesters walk barefoot every day from Kalanki to Maitighar before commencing their indefinite sit-in at Maitighar and walking back. The government has made no overtures for dialogue yet.

This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.

The protesters have been claiming that by refusing to implement past deals, successive governments have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about upholding the rule of law.


Please support her and let's give her justice that she deserves!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fl2xyt/nirmala_kurmi_case_are_you_aware_of_this_news/,9/20/2024 3:35,57,0,4,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
1en16a3,"Appreciation Post for ""Ukeraa"" and ""Ukaalo"" News. ","When it comes to follow up news, they are the best.

Usually, what happens in Nepal is, something becomes breaking news, and then all the media cover it, but after a few days, sabei kura haraucha. However, Ukerra and Ukaalo are different. Ukaalo kept publishing updates on the progress of the Bal Mandir investigation, with recent updates every 10 days or so. Even when the investigation got stuck, they kept informing about it. Balmandir update was quite heplful as even Sansads like Sumana Shrestha were raising voice about it on Parliament and social media citing this investigation by Ukaalo.

Just look at the Kailash Sirohiya news. Everyone was posting about it, but where are the updates now? Ukerra did follow-ups and found out that he had run away to Russia. He was out on ""Hajiri Jamanat,"" which means the investigation is still ongoing. According to the law, if he had to leave the country, he must contact the investiagtion authorities, inform them, get their permission, and then he can leave the country. But he didn’t follow all these procedures. According to Ukeraa's investigation, neither the Dhanusa police nor the Sarkari Wakil Karyalaya were informed about it.

Similarly, they have been following various updates. Recently, they have been reporting on a government land issue. This government land from Lalitpur-16 was transferred to a business house through internal corruption at the ward level itself. Ukaalo has started investigating it. There was also a follow-up about a kid sent to India from Bal Mandir without informing his guardians.

Today, Ukerra has started publishing news about the MRI machine purchase issue. They cover news that we rarely see in other mainstream media.

Ukaalo also did constant investigation on Basbari Land case.

Sorry if I have mixed up which outlet is updating on which case. I follow them both, so I got a bit confused.

I know media can have some level of biasness. Sometimes even reputed media post fake information. I’m not saying these media outlets are perfect, but based on my observation, these two are reliable. Ukaalo call themselves as a non profit independent media. Yesterday they tweeted they are planning to operate on a crowdsourcing model from readers rather than relying on advertisement revenue.

So yes, we should start supporting them. When it comes to online media, Onlinekhabar, Ratopati, Setopati, and Ekantipur come first. But slowly, people are turning towards Ukerra and Ukaalo. They are getting quite famous on Twitter. So yeah, start reading them.

15tq8m1,Frustrating News: Vianet Communication Blocking ONU Router Access [Soon],"Hey everyone,

I'm here to vent some serious frustration about the latest move that is going to be made by Vianet Communication. It feels like they're making things way more complicated than they need to be.

So, here's the deal – Vianet wants to block our access to their ONU routers through IP addresses. Yep, you heard that right. No more checking network status or making adjustments directly from the router. 

They're forcing us to use their Vianet app instead. And guess what? The app is slow and frustrating to use.

[To those who don't know connection status and disconnect reason helps you figure out if the problem is internet or your router is having trouble connecting with their server](https://preview.redd.it/gk1f74h8roib1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=26fab49ac732f8ed1cac0b47efff1b91b095e1b4)

But wait, there's more. This app doesn't even work offline. So, if you're stuck without internet, tough luck trying to find their support number. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea?

And get this, their reason for all of this is some vague ""security concern."" They won't give us any details, but apparently, accessing our own routers locally is suddenly a security risk. It just doesn't make sense and it's beyond frustrating.

To top it all off, they're not being transparent about the whole situation. They claim there's been a security incident, but they're not telling us anything about it. It's like they're keeping us in the dark and it's infuriating.

So, there you have it. Vianet Communication is pushing us to use their clunky app, and all because of some supposed security concern they won't explain. And if you're considering Vianet, you might want to think twice about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/15tq8m1/frustrating_news_vianet_communication_blocking/,8/17/2023 15:08,12,0,19,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

110hfdq,Updated rules and recommendation for best practices for news within /r/Nepal,"Here are some new approaches the moderation team will be taking, moving forward, for news. This is to streamline, and ease the process of news submission and consumption within the sub-reddit. After this post is live, the modus operandi of news sharing will be changed. Read on to find out more.

## Updated rules rundown

* Preferred way of posting news should be link posts, linking directly to the news in question. However, we're following the community voice to allow screenshot for the time being.

* Screenshot posts that alter/change context/befuddle the nature of the reported news will be removed on moderator discretion.

* If the prior rule can't be upheld, and thus you wish to post a screenshot of the said news, the pinned automod automod comment asking the source should have the source posted by the OP themselves. Failure to do so will have the post removed.

* News should be MANDATORY flaired as news. If a news is found to not be flaired, it'll be removed immediately. The moderation team has made efforts to make News one of the tab links on the subreddit landing page, so people who wish to view news are able to interact with news posts, without having to sift through posts themselves.

* The post title should be as-is, reported what's printed by the news media. 

* On-Topic: News that directly happens or concerns Nepal, and her subjects. Nepalese Media are immune to scrutiny of this rule.

* Off-Topic: News that have mentioned Nepal briefly that have otherwise no business being posted in /r/Nepal. As these involve the world itself, kindly post it in /r/worldnews instead.


## In submissions

* Do not post snippets or portions of news lacking context, which is intended to deceive the community. Those, even with source posts links, will be removed.

* If the title exceeds 300 characters, cropping the title whilst retaining the message is encouraged. *** However, do NOT crop it to the extend it loses the original context. ***

* Long titles that have unnecessary flair, and too many articles/adverbs/adjectives may be culled to be palatable. *** However, do not editorialize the news article, under any circumstances ***.

* Posts with gibberish and nonsensical titles will be removed.

* Do not abuse uppercases/emojis/hashtags. These quell interest, and irritate most folks.

## Demeanor guidelines in news posts

Given as news are an important facet of the community, the moderation team will be extra gentle with the news posts in general. Harassment, toxicity, and rule breaks in these will be considered serious offenses towards the community, especially since most lurking members frequent these kind of posts. As-such, it's our duty to promote active participation, not turn away potential members through standoffish hostile remarks over internet disagreements. Below are the general guidelines, for sanity's sake:

* Be kind. Don't be snarky. Converse curiously; don't cross-examine. Do not hijack/brigade a popular thread to push your agenda.

* Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of the community. We understand some news can be dark and grim, but we'll allow ***tasteful*** fulminations, not outright tirades, especially if it has excessive curses/slurs.

* Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.

* When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. ""That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3"" can be shortened to ""1 + 1 is 2, not 3.""

* Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.

* Ignore brigaders/trolls/flamers - Report/Block as necessary and move on. Avoid generic tangents. Omit internet tropes.

*** TLDR: Source must be provided, and is non-negotiable. Generally, the prefered way to submit news will now be *links*. It's alright if you wish to take a picture and post it as such, but the automod pinned comment under posts with ""News/समाचार"" will have to be replied by the source of the derived news. You're also required to flair such posts as ""News/समाचार"". ***

The cutoff point for the rules being enforced is 2/13/2022 00:00 GMT-5:45. Please keep that in mind, moving forward.

The sidebar will also be updated with this post, so as to facilitate new members moving forward.

As always, we're thankful for your support, and your continuous input in coming forth with this ruleset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/110hfdq/updated_rules_and_recommendation_for_best/,2/12/2023 14:50,0,0,16,Nepali & English,0,0,0,0,0,0

girx24,How ethical is it for online news portals to headline experiences of upper-class families positively benefiting from pandemic induced lockdown when the whole country is suffering from it?,"Especially Setopati. Because of the lockdown, the economy is going down the drain, seems like a famine is on the way, unemployment is soaring at all time high, hundreds of thousands of labourers are stranded. But Setopati's journalists think the most important news is how film directors making a use of the time to write his next film script or how upper-class kids are learning to do other shit in this free time. To top it off, today's headline news is about how some doctor cum singer has been waiting for this time all her life to write and sing songs. I personally believe this is being inconsiderate to those people who are affected by the pandemic cum lockdown.

He is Vice-Chairman of Nabil Bank too. The news topic suggested a suspicion of foul play as Chaudhary would be ineligible to open a new brokerage citing his involvement as an executive member. However, I had opened the post expecting to glance at it later. To my surprise, I couldn't find anything when I refreshed the page. Can anyone suggest if the media portal might have taken the page down? If there is someone who can work on the back end and see what was deleted, we could perhaps find more to it. Also, as a democracy, if the article were deleted subject to pressure/extortion, we need to ensure that the journalist or publisher does not get punished for expressing views (unless misstating and falsifying data).

td7nn7,The story of how I have almost ruined my career by focusing more on news and not on the course.,"I've failed CA CAP-II exams for the 4th time in a row. I've lost 2 years in this course and I don't know if I should waste more time in this.  


I was supposed to give CAP-II exams in June of 2020 but due to covid it was postponed to December 2020, which I skipped due to fear of failing as I had not prepared well.  


Then for June 2021 exams, I was preparing well but due to covid delta variant, exams were unsure. Almost every other exams were getting cancelled or postponed and most of our teachers were sure that the June exams will be merged with December exams like they did in 2020. Amidst all this chaos, at sometime I had stopped studying and was focusing more on news and exams getting postponed. The exams were finally cancelled for June 2021 but after a month in July, ICAN (the regulatory body of CA) announced that the exams will happen in August. I had left studying in May, so I got scared and again I chickened out from giving exams.  


Finally, December 2021, this was it. I had the time and was supposed to pass in this attempt. I was preparing well, I had covered most of my course but then came Omicron variant. And again I got lost in the news and stopped studying. ICAN also released a press release that exams are likely to be held in the last week of December 2021. But I thought it was impossible as I got political and was focusing more on the phrase ""likely to be held"". In the middle of December 2021, ICAN released a statement saying exams will be held after 15 days. I had only 15 days to prepare for CAP II exams, although I had studied most of the course, the time wasn't enough.   


In 7th may 2022, the results said that I was short on aggregate on both groups. I did pass all the subjects but failed short on reaching the aggregate of 50%, which means that I now have to give all the exams once again in June of 2022. The perfect nail in my coffin is that, ICAN is now considering merging June 2022 exams with December 2022 exams which means 2.5 years loss to me which is indicative from their action of not taking any new admissions for June 2022 exam batch.  


Now, if I pass in June 2022 or December 2022, it will label me as a 5th attempt pass out or a 6th attempt pass out respectively. Neither of which will allow me to join a good or even a half decent firm. This is seriously going to affect my career as a CA (if I eventually pass). I really want to become a CA, but I don't know if after all these failures I will be able to make a living out of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/td7nn7/the_story_of_how_i_have_almost_ruined_my_career/,3/13/2022 14:07,9,0,11,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

As moderators of a subreddit that garners over  130k members (out of which only 42 of them chat, and we know all of their names, what they look like, and their citizenship number), we're often approched by media houses to shill for them through our sub ""organically"".

Some months back we were approched by RONB Pvt. Ltd in interests of acquisition of /r/Nepal. As a full disclosure, RONB has given each of us monthly wages along with equity shares on their media house. After much deliberation, we've decided to proceed with the merger. We're now Routine of Nepal Bandha(RONB)'s official community hub in reddit. Do understand that we're in the stringent process of renaming the subreddit to /r/ronb from /r/nepal, and we've received correspondance from Reddit about it, that it'll take them upto 15 working days for it. Until then, we'll be making some sweeping changes to the content policy, along with a plethora of rules and guidelines changes.

* Badmouthing RONB and it's subsidiaries, or any personnel thereof, will not be tolerated.
* ""Routiney"" word is banned, as it's a slur used to demean our founders. Making fun of them is now barred.
* Only relevancy rule is RONB. Only RONB link posts will be approved. Please do not make meta posts about this.
* Discussions around the RONB founders' private lives will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
* News should be posted as soon as it is breaking around you. We'll do our best to post it asap on the main pain.
* We'll provide no additional context on news now. Neither will any of you.

Regarding our stance, a lot of people may feel the change is abrupt, but given the financial conditions of us mods, we're but merely forced to embrace this sweeping change. We'll be here to answer all of your queries, if any.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Let's not talk about the unmanaged ads section over there. Like seriously?  

I am guessing most of the website(companies) copy each other or they have same IT company proving  services (like F1Soft providing for banks) or maybe they follow same shitty theme. But why?

How come such big companies/portals have such bad designs in this IT era? Don't we have some good level of IT firms or Developers? Aren't we capable of creating good designs? I am sure, we do have good designers, Devs in our country. Also the fact, these companies are really rich.

njs9k1,Whats really is this news ordinance on citizenship law.,"It was confusing.  Especially when the English version circulating in news articles mentions children of ""bona fide citizens"" who was born in nepal will get citizenship. It means people who are doing business in a country over a entire tax year. Or at least what that means in USA couldn't find anything on nepal.

Correct me if i am wrong. But my understanding is :

>In past half century or so. A lot of indians have migrated to nepal for work or business. Nepalese gov even subsidised them and help them resettle. As there was a huge initiative to develop industry and agriculture in terai.
In 1981 Its estimated that only 2.4 million people out of 3.2million who migrated to nepal got citizenship of nepal. In 2001 its estimated that around 7 million people migrated looking for work or new life in past 35 to 40 years. 
Now they are involved in various business which doesnt necessary require paperwork or citizenship. Infact some of them settled and lived independently of gov services.

> Now all of those people who have settled in nepal  and started living permanently without citizenship and had children. They couldn't get nepalese citizenships.
So in Citizenship act (2007) there was this clause on citizenship by birth.


**(1) Any person born before 2046 Chaitra 31, Bikram Sambat (i.e. 13, April, 1990 A.D.) within the territory of
Nepal and having domiciled permanently in Nepal shall be deemed a citizen of Nepal by birth.**


>that helped a lot of those people obtain citizenship



And newly passed ordinance has added a clause to the constitution.  That will make it possible for children of these people if both of their parents are Nepalese. I think there are 5-7 lakhs of these people who dont have citizenships.  And a lot of people in nepal also at level of policymakers are sensitive about this cause a lot of them are people with ethnicity of indian origin of india. Who migrated to nepal not too long ago. due to anxiety of nepal with india. It becomes a sensitive and controversial bill.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/njs9k1/whats_really_is_this_news_ordinance_on/,5/24/2021 7:34,5,0,12,English,1,0,0,0,0,0

155haxb,"Frustration because of academic, economic and financial failure.","Please don't skip...

Basically, I \[25M\], took my SLC exam in 2069 and graduated with 85.88% at 15 years of age. Graduated my +2 in Science with 75.4% on aggregate at 2072, really loved Physics, Mathematics, some of the Physical Chemistry (yes organic and inorganic chemistry sucked, for me at least). And trust me, I achieved it without studying at home, entirely based on Teacher's teaching at school.

During my +2 days, I assuming, my father would definitely talk about me with his friends and his colleagues about what would be better. And then they probably would tell him about how their or cousin's son or neighbour's son joined engineering and how much he is earning because of that. That would raise the hopes of my father and he would come home and talk to me about how his colleague's cousin's son, who I don't know, I don't even know the colleague,  who was also fairly talented joined engineering and today's he is earning really well.

Along with that, almost everybody I was friends with in +2, were planning to join IOE, IOM wasn't an option because we were of Mathematics section. I followed my friends, went to Kathmandu, joined PEA and started preparation for Entrance. If scored decently, Civil Engineering, I never had any ambition for, I wanted to join Electronics and Communication or Computer, if got a chance. While everybody, including my father, who heard it from somebody else, said Nepal is a developing nation, it will be needing Civil Engineering here and there. It is going to have a lot of scope. Choose Civil, I'd just say okay and dismiss the talk.

By god's grace, I ranked 295th in IOE Entrance, 2072. I was excited at a chance to get to study at Pulchowk Campus because Pulchowk had 432 seats then. I filled out a form to get into the admission list, and my priorities were 1. Computer Regular, 2. Computer Full Fee, 3. Electronics and Communications Regular 4. Mechanical Regular. Admission list was out and my name was nowhere to be found. I had heard somewhere but not certainly, that there would be multiple admission where you'd have to reapply after 3rd or 4th admission list is out and the position is still vacant. which I found to be true a little later.

Anyways, I got a little scared, because as far as I know, it couldn't be true, I called my dad and stated my name wasn't on the admission list of pulchowk may be if we waited, we could get a chance. He asked me what about other campuses ? I told him I hadn't applied in Thapathali Campus which was already closed but Paschimanchal and Purwanchal were still open. He asked me to apply to Purwanchal Campus which was close to home (Biratnagar) because if you're not going to get Pulchowk , why not prefer somewhere close to home. I applied to Purwanchal Campus on Civil Regular only because I was angry that I'd not be getting desired campus, Pulchowk, why should I get desired faculty, right ? The admission list was out, my name was on the top of the admission list, finalized the admission process. That's how I became the student of Purwanchal Campus of Civil faculty.

Because this was the first time tasting the government education, I quit going classes as well because let's face it, even if it happens, its productivity was almost none existent. The teachers except for a couple of two didn't mind as long as you attended their assessment exam. So, I'd study only on the 3-day gap of the exam, yet still managed to clear 1st and 2nd semester because they were just  a little advanced refresher of +2. except for drawing, which I cleared on back exam. From the 3rd semester on, core subjects started hitting that was when I figured engineering is not just Physics and Mathematics after all. But I didn't change my way of learning, still the 3-day option. This time on, I could manage to only clear mathematics based subjects like Engineering Mathematics III, probability and statistics, numerical methods, etc.

Almost every other subjects were in my backlogs. 5/7 subjects from 3rd semester, 6/7 subjects from 4th semester, 5/6 subjects from 5th semester, 6/7 subjects from 6th semester. I didn't attend any back exam to clear them out. I just didn't care. It was then realized, if I didn't graduate, I'd be wasting 4 years of my time for nothing. I still didn't go to classes but I bought books, old questions, manual solutions, and studied myself from there. On the 7th semester, I cleared 4/6 subjects that made me genuinely happy even after though it was civil engineering I was studying. I cleared the next 2 as well on the immediate back paper and some of the other like 1 or 2 odd semester's back along with it. On final semester (held on 2076 Ashoj), I degraded a little, I cleared 3/6 subjects. And on the immediate back paper, I cleared the next 3 and some other even semester's subjects. That way my 1st and 4th year was clear during the point of 4 years. But almost every subject were remaining of the other two semesters.

Then the Covid hit, exams were pushed off, and I didn't study because I didn't know when they were going to be conducted. And then when they were conducted (around Poush 2077), regular exams of two semesters and back exam of one was conducted with 15 days gap between each other and that went disasterously. I cleared a few subjects, but not as I had hoped. Then again the second wave of covid, but it got let off a little early.

Fast forward now, when the even semester exam happened on Chaitra, I officially have spend 7 complete years (from the basis of exams conducted) on this Campus (7.5 years based on actual time). Almost everybody of my batch has already graduated. On the Chaitra of 2079, I had only 2 subjects of 4th semester remaining, ('soil mechanics' and 'hydraulics') of which I took exam of on 21st Chaitra and 12th Baisakh. Funny thing happened, I believed on 21st chaitra was the exam of Hydraulics and prepared for it up until two days before when my friend told me which subject it was. That exam went indecisively and in IOE exam, if a studnet is indecisive means fail. And during the actual exam of Hydraulics which on the 12th of Baisakh, on 6th Baisakh, I had an emergency surgery for appendicitis and got discharged on 10th of Baisakh. I took my exam any ways.

The result came out 3 days ago, my symbol number was not published. I don't know which subject I cleared or both remained uncleared, but I have to take exam once again somewhere between Dashain and Tiar. Because of this I haven't been able to hold any job. And now, I'm 25 years old with no degree, no job, no experience, financially, ecomonically and psychologically broken. At this point of time, where I should be supporting them, they're supporting me. I see the look on my father's face, it isn't as hopeful as it used to be. I just don't know how do I move forward. I don't see anything to look forward to in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/155haxb/frustration_because_of_academic_economic_and/,7/21/2023 7:59,125,0,95,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
1f8e37g,Frustrating Diet Plans. Can't find anything for an average Nepali.,"I am a M20. Looking to lose some weight because I am phat. And I have calculated everything, from my BMR, BMI, Ideal Weight, Calorie Plan, etc. Now, all I want to have is a good diet. I have the app counting the calories burn from running and workout ready to go.

DIET PLAN. MY GOD.... what the fuck am I supposed to do?? How can I, an average Nepali, living in Thulobharyang with nothing but a room, go looking for egg filled avacados now. Where in the fuck am I supposed to go looking for Kale Juice???

All this is so frustrating. All I need is a simplified Nepalified version of the diet plan. Like I can get Greek Yoghurt, that's getable because suprise suprise, it's just DAHI. Spinach rolled with potato, it's alu sag ko tarkari. I can do that bro and that's an average nepali food.

Also, most of them simply replace the larger part of our nepali food, i.e., VAT. How am I supposed to replace that as well???

Any gym-bros and chads out here that can help bro??? I am sorry for all the clowning I may have done in the past of gymbros because I see the mental planning this requires. Kudos. You guys are not just all muscles, no brain after all. (the last time this will happen.)

1atzsu4,"Why Isn't the Education System Improving, and Where's the Action? A Frustrating Reality","Today I went to my maternal uncle's home (Mamaghar) for a function. Despite arriving late after work, I was eager to catch up with everyone. It was around 6 in the evening when I reached there, only to notice that three of the kids in the family hadn't returned from school yet. The youngest is in the 6th grade, while the other two are in the 8th and 10th grades.

Curious about their delayed return, I inquired with my relatives, who explained that their school hours were extended until 6 pm due to additional tuition. The youngest one would be home soon, but the older two would be late due to extra classes. I was taken aback to learn that even a 6th-grade student has classes until 6 pm. It made me reflect on the current state of our education system, wondering if lessons have been learned or if things are getting worse.

Recalling my own experience in Grade 10, where classes stretched from 8 am to 8 pm, I realized that not much seems to have changed. Extra classes were more about rote memorization of answers from question banks rather than learning new concepts. This practice was prevalent across all schools, driven by the sole objective of ensuring high marks to maintain the school's prestige.

While the School claims that it is for the betterment of the students, they earn a good amount from those ""Extra"" classes. Our School used to force us to buy the Question Banks from the specific publications, so I am pretty damn sure, commissions were involved.

I had hoped the education system had improved, especially with the government discarding the board examination in Grade 10 (SLC). However, it appears that the situation has not evolved positively. Grade 10 students are still under immense pressure, treated as though their success or failure will determine the fate of the world.

Unfortunately, the neglect of students' mental health and personal growth remains unchanged. It was a norm then, and it continues to be so now. It seems we have not learned from our past, and the cycle persists.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1atzsu4/why_isnt_the_education_system_improving_and/,2/18/2024 17:41,11,0,10,English,0,1,1,0,0,2
16tdcuj,The three dals are the enemy. On: why we need to show the same frustration against the three dals as we do with Balen.,"I am not a “jhole” of Balen in any way so don’t misunderstand my writing of this piece. I’ve been an outspoken critic of Balen (see post history). In brief, my stance on Balen is that he has the opportunity to be a great political figure if he cleans up his act. 

In writing about Balen, I’d received critical feedback that went along the lines of, “why don’t you write about the three dals and their leaders with the same voracity?” The recent protest against Balen outside of the Rastriya Sabha Griha illuminated something in me. 

The three dals have abused their powers insouciantly. They have eroded the country and its chance at democracy. They have looted and plundered from the nation. They’ve essentially pilfered Nepal’s chance at a second wind. The first republic has been shot down before it had a chance to get going. It’s all because of the three dals. Yet, the youth are not galvanized by it. Especially not in the same way as they are for or against Balen. 

 There is a pervasive apathy and learned helplessness in the youth against the Big Three. They have crushed your soul and your hopes and dreams with their years of malpractice and corruption that young people who should know better have even taken support for the monarchy. The reason you flock to the richer western nations can be partly if not wholly explained by the inaction and inability of the three dals to create a functioning state. 

So despite all the pernicious corrosion of your daily life, you, like myself, do not seem to be galvanized against them. The big three are the ones largely responsible for a shitty constitution. They are the ones whose cadres are exposed by the media every week for some corruption. They are the ones that essentially steal your taxpayer money for their own personal gain that should go towards better amenities. They are the ones that fail to build proper institutions which would ostensibly give you hope for the future in the country. 

They are the ones that force your hand to leave the country. Do we feel so weak and powerless to speak up against folks our parent’s age and older? Is it not true that because young people are not outside of the Singha Durbar everyday protesting the fact that Nepal is a migrant labor exporter that they are complicit in the socioeconomic state of the country? Can young people showing and protesting, with the same energy and passion as outside the Rastriya Sabha Griha, bring change in the country? 

Is it not your duty to the nation to support younger, fresher parties? To be more politically aware and active so that the country can improve? Do people who have left feel any responsibility to the country? 

I am making this post because I genuinely do not understand why I was and am so passionate about policing Balen but not the three dals. This is a trend amongst all youth. The energy we saw in electing Balen during the local elections was not present in the federal elections. Young people were not as present during the moment. As young people communicated to their parents in KMC to support Balen, they did not urge their parents to not support the three dals in the federal elections. 

Are we afraid to speak up against our elders even when it means the deterioration of the nation and the state? If the governance of the country had been decent since the promulgation of the 2015 constitution, I assert that fewer Nepalis would be leaving. Nepal would not be the exporter of human capital that it currently is if the three dals had their act together. More young people would have stayed in the country, building it and its institutions, if not for the oppression from the three dals.

156a7ip,"Sudden urge in motivation and back to frustration and disappointment. It's a cycle, any tips?","\[Mid-20s M\] Whenever I try to learn anything new or do challenging tasks (let's say coding), I feel motivated to consistently pursue it for some days. A few days later, I am back to feeling demotivated, hopeless, and lost. And days keep piling up where I do not do anything. I overthink and I get frustrated with myself for wasting my time where I should be doing something productive. Then, I get back on track from where I left off to code and feel driven to learn it. Next few later, I feel sh\*t.

This has been going in a cycle. I am not being consistent. I tried 21 days method where I focused on a particular goal (studying GRE). I studied it for a month, but I quit the goal when I started feeling down. Also, I am not pushing myself to the extreme when I am working on a target.

Hey fellow r/nepal ians,

Did anyone attend the Sajjan Raj Vaidya concert? If so, you know exactly how disastrous it was. Mid-concert, a massive electricity issue disrupted the show, right before the artist was set to perform his main songs. The temporary washrooms were an absolute disaster, with piss flowing everywhere.

Fans who had eagerly waited for the main performance left disappointed and frustrated. While power outages in the Kathmandu valley are not uncommon, such issues should have been anticipated and managed by the organizing team. MN Productions, Khalti Events, Arbitrary Events, and Sajjan Raj Vaidya himself should be held accountable for this fiasco.

Given the extent of the failure, there should be a full or partial refund for all attendees. This was an outrageous disappointment, and MN Productions and Khalti Events should reconsider organizing future events if they cannot ensure basic standards. I urge all concert attendees to speak out against this scam and demand the accountability we deserve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1gsrlnh/the_disastrous_sajjan_raj_vaidya_concert/,11/16/2024 16:59,218,0,70,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

h86tub,A country with youth that have their heart at the right place but much confusion in channeling their frustration is a dangerous thing.,"TL/DR: We are at an infancy of the federal system and nobody has any experience of running that type of system so we should give it time and youths need to learn how a nation functions rather than mindlessly being followers. A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, youths are frustrated being exposed to the world culture while ours seems just laden with so many problems in each and every nook and corner. We are caught in the middle of a tortured past and uncertain future. But most of us are unwilling to learn or research something before jumping on the bandwagon and thus once again proving the notion of sheep mentality. I ask a lot of my friends who have no idea how a nation’s government functions, what the different bodies are, what the tiered government means and how they function. How the executive, legislative and judiciary work. We want so much so quickly like things in the west from countries like US but that country has been following federal democratic norms and principles for a few centuries. In contrast our country’s modern history has us being under absolute monarchy, then Rana rule, then Panchayat, then constitutional monarchy to democratic parliamentary system to finally overthrowing the shah dynasty. Though we’re celebrating democracy since 2007 BS but without properly understanding what it means. We haven’t had a proper stable government and from 2008 to the 2015 when the current constitution was promulgated. It took so many revolutions and sacrifices to get to where we are.

Just a few decades back when our literacy rate was so low, we had to move along with the globalization, technological boom and learn to walk with the modern connected world. Our parents, grand-parents aren’t able to keep up with our young generation’s mentality. They didn’t have luxuries (even basic in many cases) like we so easily take for granted today, no access to unlimited information on the internet which we do. Imagine having no concept of advanced science, economics and the world, advanced maths and every other subject that you had the privilege of studying at school. Yes, most of our parents and grand parents didn’t have that. Older generation clings to traditional values where as younger generation is mesmerized by everything western. This contradiction of the generational gap or the tug of war between the conservative boomers and progressive millenials and xz gens is at an all-time high.

Adopting the federal style of governance was talked about for long and we finally accepted it. But unlike the US or other countries with lot of experience in this system, we are at the infancy period. We just implemented it. Just 2 years back we had not named all the states. We are in a trial and test period. Nobody in our country has the experience of how federal governance works. We know how it should work but you get the gist of what I’m trying to say. Now, we have state system where many people with no previous political experience have been elected and many aren’t from a young generation. They are new to the game. Hence, they haven’t properly adapted to running their government effectively and have to resort time and again to the central government who have much experience. So, we need to give this time to gradually adjust and everyone should learn how things work rather than mindlessly following whoever sounds smart. Back when I was in school and the state system was being discussed, I learnt the con of the system was it would be very expensive.

Politics is important and affects our life whether we agree or disagree. We need to have that understanding and learn how own country’s system works. A government is not a single body. Yes, things are bad as we have a culture of boot-licking and we need to change that. We need an independent body to look after corruption. We need a directly elected prime minister. But how do we do that in a democratic way? While today everybody wants to go to school, only a handful really strive to be educated. We need to learn that. We are just an ordinary country with an extraordinary number of problems, contradictions and juxtapositions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/h86tub/a_country_with_youth_that_have_their_heart_at_the/,6/13/2020 12:42,23,0,5,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

I crave a swift, easy, and blissfully uncomplicated shopping experience.

But alas, in the land of Nepal, why, oh why, do almost every blessed online seller refuse to reveal the price of their goods? It's as if they're guarding the state secrets of a clandestine society. I mean, seriously, if you're trying to sell something to your dear customers, shouldn't you at least consider mentioning the price? Sure, I get the concept of dynamic pricing and all those clever strategies, but if your product is as stable as a sloth on sedatives, why not spare five measly minutes and scribble down the price in the description instead of waxing poetic about why your price is a mysterious chameleon that changes colors every five minutes?

What I truly yearn for is a good old dose of transparency, a refreshing sip from the fountain of accessible information. But no, the trend here seems to be the ""pp pp pp"" game, where you have to beg, plead, and perform interpretive dance just to get a hint of what something might cost. User engagement, they say? More like user enrage-ment! Why not use that dusty old brain and come up with innovative ways to entice your customers instead of following the worn-out playbook that's been passed down through generations like a cursed heirloom?

Sure, you've managed to slap together a product or start a business, but that alone doesn't exactly scream commitment. Come on, defend your creation, sell it to me like it's the last piece of chocolate in a zombie apocalypse! Your lackadaisical approach isn't just evident in your pricing shenanigans; it's like a neon sign flashing ""mediocrity"" over your entire operation. And you know what? Savvy consumers will regrettably choose to explore alternative options rather than engage with businesses that do not demonstrate a sincere commitment to their offerings and respect the time and intelligence of consumers.

Haina, isn’t it about time we challenge such absurdities? Are we, as consumers, inadvertently fueling this unwritten tradition of having to inquire about prices on every single page? Ki kaso ho? Shouldn't we aspire to higher standards? Can Nepal's market ever evolve for the better? Must we consistently tolerate scams and misleading advertisements while resigning ourselves to the phrase, ""Yestai ho yeha ko chalan""?

You know what this situation is reminiscent of? Picture yourself strolling into a superstore, eagerly seeking the price tag on a product, only to find it conspicuously absent. When you approach the seller for clarification, they reveal that the price was guarded with such secrecy that it required a covert rendezvous in a room rivaling the exclusivity of Area 51.

Ah, then we have the size conundrum, a riddle that seems to escape Nepal entirely! SIZES! Not everything is a one-size-fits-all miracle. And what in the actual underworld is ""free size""? These sellers toss around that term like confetti at a New Year's Eve party. But let's not kid ourselves, folks—it's a sham! There's no such thing as ""free size."" You can't stuff an XL human into an S-size t-shirt and expect it to magically fit like a glove. It doesn't work that way. Your lack of diversity in product sizing and inclusivity leads you to invent this absurd concept called ""free size""? Well, free size your you-know-what, you piece of nonsense!

Apologies, I digress but don't even get me started on nutritional information and ingredients on food packaging! I'm starting to believe we'll sooner discover unicorns than find those details on any Nepali product! It's like this country is run by nincompoops, and they're doing a splendid job turning everyone else into one too.

Overreacting much am I?  


Well, here's a wicked thought: maybe I should kick off a rant series to unleash my frustrations about the bizarre circus that often unfolds in Nepal. It's like a twisted form of therapy, you know?

191k22d,"Reminder : You and Nepal are not Seperate entities. You are NEPAL, so stop complaining and expecting.",""" Ohh, Nepal ma yesto bhayena, Nepal ma testo bhayena. ""  What do you think the country is ? it's you. The people of nepal, is nepal. We are responsible for what the gov does so don't come out here complaining about the government. Being a citizen is not holding your hands and expecting things to go right. It comes with responsibilities, sacrifices and Accountability.

The french did not say  ""uhh, our kings don't care about us. we are doomed""  , They fought and reclaimed their rights from the monarchy.

in ancient times The Europeans did not say "" Uhh, we have harsh winters and so many wars, look at the asian they are so lucky, they have so much fertile land and they are so rich"" , They innovated, made advancement in science & Technology and a small island of europe ended up ruling half of the world.

Even the vikings, who had to dig a hole in the ice to bring home dinner did not complain.

Every time there is trouble, People needs to get up and do something about it. And we have done it in the past. We got rid of the monarchy by rising up against it. And it paid off. Now we can vote. Balen got sick of how KTM was handled so he got off his ass and did something about it.

Who are you complaining to ? There is no one listening!!!  It's you and i and everyone together whose responsibility it is make things better.

Everyone who has done absolutely nothing. All these kids in school who just expects things to magically work out frustrates me. Every country in the world which is now prosperous was once a shit hole of a place. The people there had to endure hardship, fight and make sacrifices to make it better.

If you have someone who is in high school and you are comparing NEPAL to US or Europe without doing anything about your own country and you expect things to just be better, you have no right to judge NEPAL.

It's like going to a gym, seeing a buffed guy and saying: "" Ohh, why can't I look like that . This Gym is shit "". you have no idea what that guy had to go through to get where he is. He has suffered more than you to get that body.

Europe has had the most wars than any other continent. Those hard times forced their innovation and advancement. The more you struggle the more you achieve.

I know some of you might think i am trying to force you into giving in into my idea and narrative but that is not my intension.

 18 M here. Ditched social media and it's been a total game changer  . I remember the ""old me"" on socials, all laid-back and confident, but now it's like I'm on my own. I'm trying to connect with people my age, but most are stuck in online drama and judging others. Sometimes, I feel like I'm on the outside, watching in. But honestly, I'm cool with that. I'd rather stay true to myself than follow the crowd. It hasn't all been smooth sailing, though. I've picked up some not-so-great habits, like smoking, and my attention span has taken a hit. I'm kinda lost, not sure where I'm headed. It's frustrating seeing some jerk with a bunch of followers getting attention for all the wrong reasons while I'm here, feeling invisible. No one asks how my day was or cares about what I'm going through. On the bright side, living in the moment has its appeal, but I'm still figuring things out.

1gonmpw,My Book Order Got Cancelled Due to Price Change AFTER Confirmation on Grey np. Now the Price is More Than Double!,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I had with an online order recently, in case anyone else has faced something similar.

I ordered a book priced around Rs 2000 during the Chhath discount sale. Since my order was above Rs1500, I also qualified for free shipping. I received an email confirming my order, and after about 8 hours, I got another email saying the shipment was on its way.

However, after two days with no further updates, I reached out to the **GREY NP** Instagram account to check on the order status. That’s when I was told my order had been canceled due to a ""change in MRP."" There was no prior notification or email update informing me of the cancellation.

I feel this is an unfair practice, as they confirmed my order and even marked it as shipped, only to cancel it later due to a price adjustment. This has left me frustrated, and I believe companies should be accountable to honor orders once confirmed.

Now, when I checked, the book’s price is more than double! I thought that once an order is confirmed and marked as shipped, the price shouldn’t matter anymore.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice on how to handle this or raise it further? Appreciate any thoughts or support from the community!

**Please upvote this post to help amplify my voice!** I’m hoping that by bringing attention to this issue, GREY NP will take responsibility, apologize for the inconvenience, and honor the original price of the book. It’s not just about the money—it’s about fairness and customer trust.

1cmhqfo,Aren't the older generations entitled to respect?,"During my brother's wedding I said that I wanted to keep my hair loose and free, an older lady from our extended family said that if we don't tie our hair negative energies will be attracted towards us   (let me know if it's true), and when I asked Where she learned it from, she said that her grandma told her, the old lady is 89 years old herself, during those times superstitions were widely believed. If it was just a suggestion it would've been my decision on what to do with MY hair. On the day of the wedding all the female cousins started to get ready in a single room.  We made our eldest sister ready first cuz she is the first sister of the groom Ani there would be many things involving her. That old lady literally yanked my sister's hair(her hair and makeup was done) and shouted (in the wedding home) ""Kapaal bannu bhaneko hoina alaxina haru, dai ko bihe ma timiharule nai Bhoot bolaune bhayau"" we were dumbfounded on what to do cuz all the guests were present there.

 And no she doesn't have any mental health problems. She even disrespected my cousin who's plus size, in a loud voice in front of everyone she said, ""Nani Bhai ko bihe ma 20 kg ta ghataune hola ni"" she said that 3 days before the wedding, my cousin wasn't even familiar with who that lady is(she was from the other side of the family). 

She misbehaved so much that because of her the excitement of a wedding was all dissolved.  Nobody liked that lady and we couldn't even tell her anything in return because we were told by our parents that she's an elder and we have to respect her. During the 
Beuli Mukh herne ceremony  she even said that ""Aba kaam garna xode hunxa.

So, instead of giving ""looks"", giving hand gestures, scream I suggest to apologize when in wrong and ignore when damage isn't a dent in your wallet.

Those who don’t know what vitiligo is, it’s called dubi in nepali. It is not a skin disease it’s a skin condition where your body lacks melanin which results to discoloration on your skin and leaves white patches on your skin. 
Now getting back to what i was saying, i used to get bullied in the worst way possible. I was about to be raped because someone (my bestfriend at that time) thought i am vulnerable and weak minded so he could sympathize with me so that he could get close to me and have sex. I have been through hell just because of something which I can’t even control. 
I got treatments for over a decade. And for the name of being “NORMAL” i went from hospitals to ayurvedic to homeopathic and what not. I even had cow dung mixed with cow’s urine because i was desperate to get this cured. I used to literally smell like cow dung no matter how much i used to bath.

When i am taking public vehicle, people treats and looks at me like I’m some kind of alien. Giving me bullshit statements and all which really affected me a lot. But still i managed somehow. I tried to stay strong in all this process and I’m still trying. I worked my ass off to get all the skills i have today. 
I am a chef(or should i say would be) i am really good at what i do. I literally worked like a donkey from even 15-20 hours a day sometimes. I can proudly say i am good at this, not being over confident tho. But now when it’s time for me to get a proper job, my vitiligo is being a problem. 
I work in hospitality industry if vitiligo was communicable i would not be here, if we talk about being presentable to the guest, i am in back of the house. When this thing doesn’t affect me or anyone then why can’t my skills be put over my skin condition and given me a chance? I don’t even want to open my gmail anymore because it is filled with 100+ rejection mails. 
I just wanna say, if you see someone unusual as per the society maybe treat them equally. Because we are dealing enough already we don’t want to be sympathized or be stared at. Just treat us equally. 

PS: I’m sorry to bore you with long whatever this is, i am just so f* frustrated cause someone again reminded me that my vitiligo might be more important than my skills today and i am sick and tired of being treated like this to the core.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/18l1ydn/is_having_vitiligo_really_a_problem/,12/18/2023 6:14,59,0,66,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1crv8tt,Life is hard in Kathmandu if you don't own a private vehicle.,"As a regular public transport user, life here is frustrating when it comes to traveling. I mean, there are so many issues with public transport that one could write pages of rants about it. We live in the so-called capital city of the country, but it's hard to find a bus after 7 pm (6 pm in winter). We often hear about women being harassed on buses too. Even in this subreddit, there are frequent posts about this issue. Pickpocketing has increased significantly.



The main thing that I hate about public transport here is the crowd.Gundruk khocheko jasto kochan manche. Hami pani k garna sakchaum ra? Sab lai afno destination pugnu nei cha so khocherei bhae ni janchaum. Ajjha bihanei pack bus ma chadnu pare ta jhan mood nei kharab. Yeso kaile katei jum bhane ni bus ko travel socherei lyang lagcha.



Then there's the behavior of conductors. Some are good and well-behaved, but others seem to be waiting for an opportunity to loot you. Even when you show them your ID card or give them the exact fare, they argue, saying, ""Bhada badhisakyo"" ""Yati nei ho"" etc. You have to negotiate even when you're in the right. Yati kura ko lagi pani traffic lai complai garchu bhanera bhannu parcha ani balla manchan, koi ta tesma ni mandeinan.  Moreover, if you're new to Kathmandu or a tourist, they'll ask you for double fare. There was a post here by someone whose relative from Terai who was unaware of the fare was charged double.



I'm glad that we have services like Pathao and Indrive nowadays. Yes, they're not always affordable, but they've been very helpful, especially at night. Every time we hear mayors and ministers talk about improving public transport, but they never take any steps towards its improvement. Sometimes, I watch videos of public transport in Japan and European countries, and I'm amazed. Then I compare it with ours, and it's shit. I know we can't compare ourselves with them, but come on, decent public transport is a basic necessity in big cities.



The number of passengers and the number of available buses aren't balanced. On top of that, the public transport union is so strong that no one can hold them accountable. There's syndicate on some routes. There was an article by Ukaalo about how Nepal Yatayat has a monopoly on its route. Also, with the constant change of ministers, every time the transportation minister changes, progress stalls. I watched an interview with Chiri Babu Maharjan (LMC mayor), and he mentioned that each time a new transportation minister arrived, he discussed improvement plans with them. However, as soon as plans were made, the minister would be replaced. Most of them don't even provide any briefing or information to the new minister before leaving office. So, this cycle continues.

Yes, we have Sajha Yatayat with huge buses and everyone prefers them, which automatically makes it crowded. Sajha has introduced new electric vehicle (EV) buses, but they are very small.

For now, if we could just travel on a bus that isn't too crowded, that would be revolutionary. I am not even asking for metros and all. Just improving public buses would solve most of the problems.

1299uil,Stop blaming the country for your failures and incompetence,"Everyone here just talks about how shit Nepal is and that they want to go away asap and the country is somehow blocking their progress. Meanwhile, not lifting a finger in effort to make things right. Just pure frustration, insecurity, incompetence and ungratefulness on display. 

It's truly "" naachna jandaina aagan tedo"". Yo case ma aagan alikati badhi tedo hola teti matra ho. Focusing on the tedo aagan and spreading negative energy ain't gonna help. 

Of course the country is full of political unrest, corruption and its horde of flaws, but if you're not well informed or fail to accept that reality then the fault lies in you. The country is what it is. If it's not suitable for one, then one can leave and try for a better life elsewhere. People are living satisfying lives whether it be here (they didn't whine about lack of opportunity, system chhaina, yo tyo) or also by going abroad, without making ungrateful noise. These theoretical complaints and rants are going to amount nothing. 

I see people having family and social issues who think it's the fault of 'Nepalese society'. Consider that due to globalization and internet, people have become very opinionated and such problems exist even more so in, for example American society.

You guys sound like "" my parents fed me, nourished me, instilled good values in me. But they were poor and used to shout at me sometimes and not let me do certain things, I hate my parents. They're the reason for my failures"". 

This post is not to discourage people leaving the country (the country doesn't either) but it can be done so in a good mind with some gratefulness towards where you were born and nourished.

(edit) People are just creating strawmans from this post and arguing their personal agendas and venting personal frustration even when they have nothing to do with the post. The post is just an excuse to bring out your personal agendas eh?

We know about the country's shortcomings, even the patriotic ones do. But you can either rise above it or be limited by them. Spread awareness, bring change, adjust or leave.

1f3c9jl,Is this even allowed in a school?,"So........, I am the guy whose sister was blackmailed by one her classmates. But I am not here to talk on that situation. Though, there have been some actions like a week suspension to her but still no money has been returned and I am still asking for it. But, I am not here to give an update on the situation. It's long and frustrating. 

So, today was my day off from work and after my studies. I went to my sister's school to discuss on the situation. If any information about the parents have come up front and they have responded (they still haven't).   
  
Then after like an hour long discussion with the principal on the situation. I was going to go to my home. But, then I saw one of the teachers pulling out a DAMN SAW in front of a kid. I rushed there and grabbed his hand and pulled it out. Then asked him what he was thinking. He was like I was just punishing this kid. And I asked him why?

Then he said that that kid who is like in like 2nd or 3rd standard was making noise in the library. I asked him if he was mad or something. The librarian was standing there saying nothing and when I asked her how much noise did he make. She was like he was making noise for some time. I asked her if she asked him to shut up or something. She did say yes and then he didn't do anything.

The teacher with the saw was working on a model cause an event is coming up really soon. Then hearing the noise in the library he asked what the problem was and then just pulled the kid out of the library. Then, with a saw he threatened the kid and I pulled him away. Then the teacher came and started to again threaten me saying that I was in the school and they cannot allow such brawls. My guy literally threatened a kid whose like in 2nd or 3rd standard, traumatized him and made him and like almost made him to piss himself was telling me that.

The principal came running and handled the situation at that time and told the teacher to do his work and asked me to leave. But, I was genuinely worried for my sister at this school. Matter of fact, I studied in this school like 2 years ago and have spent 12 years there but never experienced such things but now these situations are occurring in the school. I just went to my home and kept on wondering how's that kid gonna be before sharing this in the sub-reddit",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1f3c9jl/is_this_even_allowed_in_a_school/,8/28/2024 14:54,31,0,31,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

14z734y,What shall I do in such situation??,"I finished my +2 in 2022 and made a plan to study in the United States. I took the SAT and received good results. And I started the entire thing myself. I applied to good universities and received a good amount of scholarships as well. I went for an interview, but the vo didn't say much. First of all, when I walked in, he pretended I wasn't there and didn't respond for 30 seconds, and I was dying from nervousness. He asked me to tell me about myself, and while I was answering, he asked me to stop and held me with a yellow slip. This was extremely frustrating for me. And I found out that there were many rejections the same day I had my interview. I eventually got used to the rejection and moved on. 

&#x200B;

While I had no option or plan to study engineering in Nepal, I applied for India through the Indian Embassy. They haven't responded in over a month. Since I've already lost a year, it's gradually becoming more frustrating. My parents are truly out of control, cursing and taunting me every time I have to face such a situation with my parents. I'm really frustrated right now.  Making me feel like a failure in every situation, pointing out everything I haven't done, gradually increasing my frustration level, and destroying my inner peace. Every week, my parents get mad at me. They made me feel as if I had lost this year, and now he is finished, unable to do anything in life, having had his visa rejected, and so on. I'm currently attempting to learn new skills, but they don't seem to understand. While I try to convince them that I am learning things, they mock me and say you are just surfing the internet and learning nothing.   


Now I have the choice of studying here in engineering, which is extremely difficult even to pass. I've seen my senior good brothers and sisters struggle with back exams. Another option is to go to India if the embassy accepts me. However, the likelihood appears to be low because the Indian Embassy is a place where politics and corruption are highly favored. As a normal citizen, my admission to an Indian university depends entirely on luck, little I am hopeful. This way, I shouldn't stay here to study engineering, but they are taking a long time to decide. And my parents don't get me and keep taunting and scolding me for no reason; they have a problem with everything I do. This makes me sad. I agree that I wasted a year without accomplishing anything. But am I that bad that I am constantly taunted and scolded by my parents for silly reasons? Anyone on Reddit who has dealt with a similar situation, please share your experience. Also, Please give me some advice on how to talk to my parents about this.

1ew3tz5,"Its not the road, its the population. (Traffic Rant) ","I am getting frustrated day after day while riding in the streets of kathmandu. Bad roads? I can ride slowly, puddles after rain? I am skilled to manuver around/over it. Any road deformality or inconvineince is somewhat tolerable for me. However, people is what I cannot tolerate at all. 

**Backstory :** All my childhood, i had my bike(GTA bicycle) which I would often ride for hours and even helped my dad to runs some errands. This gave me a life long perspective of what road ethics are and why I should always respect them. Even when I was 14/15, I was skilled enough to go from baneshwor to bhaktapur/ godawari/ kalanki, etc with friends who were equally skilled. 

**History :** I got my license on my first attempt thanks to years of handling/ balancing exercise (not literally). And my first bike was pulsar ( I am not a dalal). And since that day, I have regret every time I have to get on my bike. I am a very moderate rider. I am never in a hurry and even if I am, it does not effect my riding style. I donot gear up tbh (riding jacket, boots, etc) but I do wear proper helmet and gloves. I choose to ride within speed limits and I am not very interested in reving up unless I genuinely want to (when i feel absolutely safe) 

**Rant :** I have come to a realization that even if I ride following each and every handbook rules, I will still end up getting rear-ended, side-scratch, and rammed into which I have gotten myself into.   
**Sooooo.....** Why is every fucking person in a hurry? JUST WHyyyy? Its like traffic sence(spidy) to honk just 0.01 seconds before light turns green. ITS ALL SAME AND SCRIPTED. Why do riders feel the need to dip their noses in the most impossible space infront of you forcing you to choose between letting him go or punch his face because he is obviously going to scratch your bike if you dont. Why does every car have to drive in middle!? at 20kmph!!! because idiot riders need to go infront of a car and stop eventually because its the same infront! Why does every typical office uncle jerk their bike around in traffic with either luggage or a pillion. And why, WHY, do every riders feel the need to overtake from opposite lane in a stopped traffic just to create MORE FUCKING TRAFFIC. Like how can you not have a single brain cell to think, ""Ohhh, if use the other lane to get infront which is obviously jammed and nobody is able to move, maybe I will only make the traffic worse."" And you know what finally cuts my single thread of patience and respect, is when they SLAM MY BIKE and ignore me like they fucking can. Like hey, you just scratched my bike that i wash like a slave every two weeks by your scooter which has to wait every monsoon season to actually get wet, can i atleast get a fucking SORRY????. 

**Conclusion :** Its a mess out there. Every time I turn my ignition on, I plan my route to avoid such places with monkeys with driving license. I have developed an instinct where I automatically check side mirrors whenever my bike slows down even a 1kmph. I am literally scared to turn even if I gave side signal like 5 seconds ago because there will always be a bike/scooty on my right trying to overtake. Maybe its me holding a flower in the middle of a NO MANSLAND hoping that others would do the same or maybe I am the only unskilled MOTO GP rider but yeah, thats why I think its first the people, then the roads. You can clown on me now.

1akqqy9,Unpleasant Experience with US Embassy Customer Service in Nepal,"I recently had a frustrating encounter with the telephone customer service at the US embassy in Nepal, and unfortunately, this isn't the first time. My initial experience was during my visa application a few years back, and now, as I'm applying for my parents' visa, I've encountered the same individual who behaved in a rude and unprofessional manner as a customer service representative multiple times when I tried to call them.

The woman in question consistently interrupted us, refusing to let us complete our questions. Her responses ranged from telling us to ""shut up"" to claiming they ""don't have time,"" all while we were trying to ask questions in a polite manner. Rather than dismissing queries with rudeness, a simple acknowledgment of not having the information would have been enough.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation when reaching out to the US embassy's customer service? Does anyone know the proper channels for reporting such behavior to the US embassy?

I thought ship garda kei bhako hola (didn't mind the packaging suru ma). Also they didn't send the extra gift as mentioned.
I sent the pics daraz chat ma and the seller said so sorry, saman return gardinu aba dekhi esto galti hunna. I also called the seller (CG) and asked for replacement since it had 5 years warranty. They said hami le daraz lai deko, tei bata process garnus, uha haru le replace gardina bhancha bhane we'll replace. Bro tf?? you sent me the item and it has warranty you should be responsible haina?

uephrn,Balen has to win!!!,"**Now, this is more than a wish.**

A plead for the city. A city which we are dearly hating more each day. Why? **Because it's filthy, the system is filthy, there's no change**. The same shit happens every time. **Someone comes waving his party's flag, buttering our old voters with their hefty, overly ambitious agendas, gets elected, and then...nothing. 1 year passes, and s/he starts making excuses, as to why his agendas, are not being implemented, following years the same thing is repeated, adding more dirty political accusations, which has made me frustrated, a lot.**

And, there are people coming to the comment section saying, *""bAlEn aYeRa cHaI K cHaMaTkAr gArChA rA?""* I don't know why you're so pessimistic regarding every event. If a guy like Keshav Sthapit, a guy who has no control over his emotions and speech, whose main reason of getting into this candidacy is his ""continuation of legacy"" is up for Mayor, Balen is 100x more qualified than him.

Chamatkar chaiyeko haina bro/sis, break chaiyeko ho. He might not be able to control the politically crippled bureaucracy of this city, but WILL WE EVEN KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T EVEN TRY? Let's be an optimist, for once, for this city.

He's not in any way, the MP from Nayak, solving all the problems of the city in a single day. I get it. But, he's also not the guy, who's gonna sit leaning in his chair, talk shit to media, vow to construct metro/rail without even a preliminary study if that's even possible.

All of us know he's a youth, if you have done some research from your side you certainly know that he has been planning for this for quite some time, does know what this city needs right now, small maintenance, small changes, small steps. He's clear about what's next step is.The other candidates have already shown their toxic nature inherited from the political background they come from.

I can't imagine what will happen to this city if a suitable candidate doesn't hold office in the coming years. This trend of incompetent fuckasses holding the office needs to stop. It has to stop now, vote for Balen, make your parents vote for Balen, and make them realize how important it is.

1dl7kws,How many of you are travelling/travelled abroad as a means for freedom rather than good future and all?,"This post is kind of a rant rather than a discussion but feel free to add your own opinions too. I think many Nepalese have travelled or is travelling overseas simply because they wanna be adults. I am a 22 year old guy, goes college in the morning, works by the day, go gym evening and the only free time I have is a short window after 7:30/8 PM. There are days when the mind gets exhausted and I'd want to go to rock bars being a musician myself. But my parents stand in the way saying ""rati che jane haina"". Yes we can say that parents think of our safety. But times have changed, social security has strengthened, not all Thamel bars is a hub for jadiya haru jhagda garne thau. As a working adult it feels extremely frustrating having to seek permission yet alone denied when I wanna have some time off. 

Since this has been eating me up I've been planning to move overseas for my Master's for two reasons, I'm a psychology student and thus doing Masters here is well, a joke. and 2nd simply to be able to escape the atrocities of my parents. I barely go on trips and if I plan for a trek or a 3-4 days visit to some place outside the valley, it's usually accompanied by a week-long of pleading and convincing. I've never felt like an adult even though I'm 22, yes young still but old enough to have some time off, trips, basically not 16 anymore. Everytime I need to ask something, I go back to feeling like a teenager and I'm goddamn scared if this is gonna be my whole life. How long do I have to keep asking. How more adult does one need to be to get to do a one night-off.

In my dad's time, they got the nuclear family simply by moving to Kathmandu from their village. And I guess he hasn't really faced not having freedom thus wouldn't know how to treat me. But that's not suffice to ease the frustrations though. If not abroad I'm truly gonna be stuck under their turf and basically be a grumpy old man who hasn't had any life experiences other than office, job and college. 

Lack of opportunities, fucked up government policies, income v/s expenses, all of them are important factors in the brain drain problem, yes. But more than that I think is the desire to escape from the society, a desire of freedom at the end. I can see people saying bidesh ma ni bhada hannu paryo, khatnu paryo paisa kamauna, nepal nei thik. No bro, I'd choose to work day and night to clean my wings of freedom than put a bandage over the scars and wounds of regrets and frustrations. And, I think many people would, well at least who has been in the situation I'm in.

nm7mtw,I am tired of you bunch just complaining and not doing anything to bring change.,"As mentioned above, I am just tired. Everyone knows that this country sucks but few people know why. It sucks because you suck. Remember what Bertrand Russel said, ""Democracy is the process by which people choose the man who'll get the blame."" It is simple as that. So let us stop blaming everything to the Government or the Big Man because we are just proving Mr. Russel right.

The crème de la crème of this land are serving the US, Europe, or other developed countries and the second bests want nothing more than an Australian visa. It's completely fine with me though. In this day and age, we are free to live wherever we want. What I am not fine with is people who are somehow stuck here, just ranting on and on about how intolerable everything is. It is shit, of course it would smell! What do you expect Sherlock? 

And the best of all? Whenever you ask a ranter about why doesn't he contribute towards fixing anything, you'll always get the holier-than-thou answer. Because nobody can. No sir, the correct answer is that you can't and frankly you don't want to. You lot are the PUBG generation who waste hours and hours in that meaningless endeavor increasing your Dopamine threshold in vain. You are so mired by that braindead game that you don't even know what mired means. You want everything fixed and sorted and just right. Well news flash kids, if you don't fix anything nothing will be fixed.

What can you do then? There are loads of things you can. Let me list some of them:

\> Involve yourself in volunteering organizations. Aarambha, Leo, Jaycess etc sounds good.

\> Study. As simple as it may sound, your critical development would mean contribution to the country's development.

\> Get yourself involved in alternative politics. Saajha, Bibeksheel whatever you can get your hands on. It would at least allow you an outlet for your frustrations of current affairs and provide you with a \*pack\*. You can graduate from that party when you feel like it.

\> Improve your Language. A person with good linguistic abilities is a person who thinks better. शिष्ट एवं परिष्कृत भाषा तथा आचरणको महत्व थोरैले मात्रै बुझेका हुन्छन. I don't mean just Nepali. English too. If not anything, it would make it easier for you to leave this country.

\> Go for the Loksewa. I work with people so powerful yet so dumb that I would rather pick any one of you to work under. So why not make that a reality? Do you have the courage of working on 35K per month for the near foreseeable future and improve the country from within?

\> Go for Journalism. Journalists are the eyes and ears of the country. We need good folks there.

\> Vote. Your vote is your weapon. Don't make the mistake of voting for idiots come the next election. Don't let your family vote for the ""party"". Vote for the person.

\> If you think there aren't good people to cast vote for, then stand as a candidate yourself. Let the oldies know that there are fresh bloods in town.

187mb3y,Nam matra Nepal bhayo.,"This debate is no more about if there should be a monarch or a minister. I think this debate should be about us nepalis , why are we like this, why are we stupid , why do we have no morals , why do we hesitate to take action.  Everyday I see a new scenario played by a new character . I've learned to observe these characters in the streets ,busses and even my college. Many foreigners might think lack of education might be the issue...that is why they categories the people of our nation. Ctrique their odour, their style , their behaviour towards the slightest scenarios. Today I observed certain people in my college they were sitting behind us in the dining table . They were a big group and had ordered quite a bit of food and after they had eaten they choose to leave their leftovers and dirty dishes without cleaning up and I could see those poor didis cleaning up the table visibly looking frustrated . Keep in mind these are students of a so called good high-school in nepal. Another scenario I took the bus home today and saw a group of colleges kids that  were tearing up the seats while recording a video . People seemed to not care , Well how would they the bus was so overcrowded that people barely had space to breathe and stinking armpits unwashed clothes and bodies against each other .
 I would recommend the nepali public transportation system if you ever want to raise your blood pressure . People talking the likes of cast their land their recent trip abroad while handing out a torn note to the conducter and saying how expensive has it gotten and leaving the bus .Another one character a middle aged lady having a kitkat on the bus and later wiping her sticky hands on somebody elses jacket is the context of people in our nation . I no longer choose to blame the government, it is the people that are too blame . The people who blame the government are either the people mentioned above or a uncle infornt of a TV that complains while he sits their doing nothing growing his already big 54 inch waist while blaming his wife for putting to much sugar in the tea . For everyone asking I'm not a rajabadhi nor maubadi I'm a buddhi badi . I just happen to prefer the system of monarchy over this current one and yes I'm allowed to say this without having an argument and justifying this statement because the same person that killed 17 thousands people sits as our prime minister and has brought ""freedom"" to our nation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/187mb3y/nam_matra_nepal_bhayo/,11/30/2023 16:16,77,0,36,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1e568tu,Addressing learning disabilities in Nepals education system.,"I'm frustrated with the education system in Nepal. As someone with dyslexia, I had an incredibly tough time in school. The Nepali education system made it even harder because it doesn't recognize any learning disabilities yet.

I'm currently in university and writing a stand-up skit about my struggles with dyslexia in school. Looking back, it's all just a funny story now. Dyslexia doesn't magically go away after you leave school, but you do get somewhat used to it.

However, there are probably lakhs of people still struggling with dyslexia in Nepal, and most of them don't even know what it is. They often just think they're stupid, and their teachers certainly don't help them.

I needed to vent after all the thinking I've done today, but I also want to find a solution to this issue. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has struggled or is still struggling with dyslexia. So, if anyone wants to join me in figuring out how we can address this problem, please feel free to dm me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1e568tu/addressing_learning_disabilities_in_nepals/,7/17/2024 1:51,4,0,24,English,0,1,1,1,0,0

1hpfqme,Unpaid Internship Issue—Company Refusing to Pay My Earned Commission,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my experience and seek some advice. I recently completed my first internship, which lasted about 2–2.5 months. It was an unpaid internship, but they had promised a commission if interns managed to bring in clients.

I worked really hard and successfully brought in one proper client. I was expecting some compensation for my effort, especially since I’m a student and even a small amount matters to me.

However, after leaving the internship due to personal reasons, I’ve been following up with the company regarding my commission. They keep telling me the client hasn’t paid them yet, so they can’t pay me either. I decided to wait, but it’s been 5 months now, and I’m still unpaid. Worse, they’ve stopped replying to my messages for the past month.

While the amount isn’t huge, it’s hard-earned money, and it’s frustrating to be ignored like this. I’m starting to feel like I’ve been scammed.

Has anyone faced a similar situation? What steps can I take in this case? Any advice would be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1hpfqme/unpaid_internship_issuecompany_refusing_to_pay_my/,12/30/2024 5:09,5,0,4,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

1ho7f1y,"Feeling Stuck After BBS: Regret, Struggles, and Seeking Advice for a New Path","I’ve been feeling stuck lately, and I wanted to share my situation in hopes of finding some guidance or hearing from others who’ve been through something similar.

I graduated with a BBS (Bachelors in Business Studies), but honestly, it wasn’t a degree I wanted to pursue. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to take it up and complete it. While I managed to get through it, I’ve struggled to feel any sense of passion or fulfillment with this choice.

Right now, I’m working as a Front Desk Officer. It’s a job, and I’m grateful for that, but it’s not something I see myself doing in the long run. To try to move forward, I enrolled in MBS (Masters in Business Studies), again due to circumstances rather than desire. Unfortunately, I failed my first semester, and now I’m seriously considering dropping out because I feel even more disconnected from this path.

On top of that, I’ve attempted a few bank exams, thinking it might be a way to pivot or build some stability. I prepared diligently, but I haven’t been able to clear any of them so far, which has been disheartening.

I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle of regret and frustration about my academic and career choices. I can’t stop thinking about how things might’ve been different if I had pursued something I was genuinely interested in.

I’m curious if there’s anyone here who has gone through something similar. Specifically:

* Has anyone else felt trapped in a career or academic path they didn’t choose or enjoy? How did you navigate out of it?
* Are there any BBS graduates here who successfully pursued a master’s degree in a completely different field(example psychology) and managed to switch their career path?

I’m open to any advice, suggestions, or stories of hope. I know I need to make a change, but I feel overwhelmed about where to even start.

1fhexn7,Have you read the book Pagal Basti by Saru Bhakta?,"I just completed the book Pagal Basti by Saru Bhakta. It was good. I had heard a lot about it, so I decided to give it a try.

I won't lie, I was disappointed with the second part. I know it's a philosophical book, so expecting some kind of thriller or huge plot was a mistake. But again, the initial part of the book made it seem like it was some kind of mystery. The first part really had me hooked. I was binge-reading it.

Then the second part started, and it went on and on. Yes, I liked the take on ego, love, and everything. The characters were well-made too. There are moments where you feel angry, moments where you feel sad, moments that make you smile. The world-building was really well done. But I don't know, something felt missing for me. There were moments when I was getting angry with Aadhi Mata, and then Jamuna as well. The Prakash character didn't make sense at the beginning. I mean, the dude just got rejected and went on a mission to become a guru.

Yes, I understand the philosophical aspect and all. The book was written 33 years ago, so I understand I can't judge it completely from today's perspective. I did like the book, but I’m here to give some criticism. I hated Aadhi Mata's take on love though. For her, love was everything. Even during the Prem and Jamuna situation, she constantly wanted Jamuna to accept Prem as her lover, but Jamuna was giving negative comments about Prem. Then at one point, it seems like Prem got fed up and detached from it all. Now Jamuna is sad that Prem has moved on, and Aadhi Mata is angry at Prem for giving up on love. I mean, lady, do you know how much humiliation he’s suffered to reach that point?

Also, one thing that made me laugh is how Aadhi Mata casually became “Mata.” I mean, she was there looking for her guy, and then everyone starts calling her Mata, and she accepts herself as a mother figure.

I felt sad for the dog character though. I was afraid the villagers might kill her, and that's exactly what they did. I was angry at the villagers at various points. One was during the Dashain market when they were making comments and gossiping. Then when Bindu the dog saved the calf’s life by feeding it her milk, the villagers started considering her some kind of incarnation of a god. But as soon as they found out she was the dog from Pagal Basti, they started making negative comments about her.

Also, while reading, you understand why people call them Pagals. Just because they have a different life philosophy and follow a different pattern, people start viewing them as Pagals. They’ve all been through hardships that made them frustrated with life, and their guru, Prakash, definitely helped them recover from it.

Like I said, I agree that the book is good. It won Madan Pursakr as well so that itself proves how good it is. Darshanik way ma herne bhe it's a good read. I had a good time reading it, but I read one review that said the beginning plot was so good, only for the story to take another turn. And that hit me because I thought the same. I guess I wanted this be a suspense thriller so I missed the point. So, I decided to make this post.

Anyway, it's a classic. You should give it a read.

1c2sg0s,Rant about my life since the Corona Pandemic," 

After the coronavirus lockdown began, I noticed several changes in myself. I seemed to have lost my academic drive; all that remained were my lazy and focused personalities. Additionally, my social skills deteriorated to the point where basic conversations became difficult. Naturally, this decline in conversational ability has also led to a plummet in my self-esteem.

Setting those issues aside, one of my main concerns is my inability to study effectively. I struggle to engage with coursebooks and can't even force myself to read a complete book. It's as if I hit a wall after just one page. This lack of studying is particularly troubling because I'm in my final year of high school, and my board exams are less than a month away.

lf7urg,Nepal isn't THAT bad!,"Recently, it seems like everyone is frustrated with Nepal.  From Facebook, news articles to even this sub, all that's going on is how shitty Nepal is and how shittier it's getting. Nothing has happened in the last 70 years, Nepal will be empty soon, Everyone is moving out! Everyone is taking bribes!! AAAHHH!!!

Yes, Nepal is not developing at the pace that we want. And there are so many low hanging fruits to improve our country that aren't being ""picked"".  But we must not forget that in the entire history of our country, we have never been as rich as we are now. Our infrastructure have been the most developed they have ever been. More and more roads, hydropower, factories, farms are being opened everyday. More and more Nepalis are getting educated. More and more Nepalis are stepping out of poverty everyday. Tourists coming to Nepal are increasing every year (except 2020). Our economy is growing every year.

I don't want to say that I'm satisfied. Of course I'm not. The motherfuckers running this place are incompetent bastards. I get that. But from looking at social media and talking to friends, I get a sense that everyone thinks Nepal is going nowhere. It's a shithole. The only way I'm going to have a good life is if I go abroad.

A [recent study](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/324191/gallup-global-emotions-report-2020.aspx) showed that out of 140 countries Nepalis ranked in 134 for positive thinking. We are one of the most negative thinking societies in the world. And we look at everything that's happening from a negative lens. I just wanted to say that Nepal isn't that bad. Yes, we are far behind the rest of the world. But we are taking steps forward. And if we let democracy do its' thing, eventually we are going get good leaders and we will be able to develop this country.

The rescue mission is still going on, but as per recent news, more than 50 people are missing. They haven't found the buses yet. This is so scary.

If you think about it, this landslide causing accidents and blocking the road has been a regular news story as far as I can think of. Every year, the government allocates millions of rupees for maintenance of this road, but the problem never stops. Recently, ADB even provided 3 Arba for this road maintenance too. They can't even build roads properly.

I'm just frustrated, man. I know the terrain is difficult, and we can't completely blame them because natural disasters can't be completely avoided. I know it might be difficult to build safe roads in the terrain and all, but come on, you can't blame everything on nature. Also, if they feel like nature is the problem, then why don't they block the road at certain times during peak rainy days? I know it might not be the solution since it is the most important highway that connects to Kathmandu, but what else can be done? If they can't avoid disasters, then just block the road or something.

However, when I opened the box at home, I found that the phone was already opened and had several scratches on the tempered glass, near the charging port, the camera bump, and the back body of the phone. It looked like it had been used for months.

I called Gadgetbyte immediately and was told ""yo ta review unit ho, hami sab winner lai testai dincham"", which is why it was in that condition. But this looks far worse than just being a review unit.

So, I sent them a detailed email with photographs of the phone's condition, but I haven't received any response. I’m really frustrated and not sure how to proceed from here.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? Do you think taking this issue public on social media or other platforms would help? Any tips on how to escalate this effectively? I’d really appreciate any advice or support. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

1. Documented everything with photographs.
2. Sent a detailed email to the company (no response yet).

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.

1ghetjc,"""The Hypocrisy of Judgment: A Reflection on Human Flaws.""","It’s truly astonishing, to say the least, how the human propensity to critique and ridicule those in the public eye—be it celebrities, politicians, or various figures ensnared in scandal—often goes hand-in-hand with a glaring hypocrisy. The very individuals who cast judgment seem blissfully oblivious to the fact that they, too, are far from immaculate in their conduct.

As I traverse the intricate journey of life, gathering experiences and forging connections with a diverse tapestry of individuals, I find myself increasingly perplexed by the disconcerting absence of a moral compass in some. The prevalence of deceit, theft, and outright betrayal lays bare the darker, more troubling aspects of our society, revealing a troubling truth about humanity's flaws.

While I fully acknowledge that perfection is a mere illusion, it’s evident that many grapple with feelings of regret or remorse, wrestling with their inner conflicts. Yet, for a significant number, such sentiments appear to be entirely absent, or at the very least, obscured from my perception. I have encountered these individuals in various situations, and it’s a disheartening reality; either they’ve never been taught the importance of empathy and accountability, or they’ve simply opted to ignore the fundamental lessons of our shared humanity.

What truly irks me—what triggers a deep sense of frustration—is the audacity of these self-righteous critics. They demand higher standards from others while embodying the very flaws they vehemently condemn. It’s a spectacle that’s both comical and infuriating, watching them protest against the corruption of others while simultaneously engaging in their own acts of theft and deceit, as if they somehow occupy a moral high ground that is, in truth, nothing more than a delusion.

At times, I feel an overwhelming urge to articulate a harsh truth: ""You’ve forfeited your right to complain."" Yet, I recognize the futility of such a sentiment—what a tangled web we weave, ensnared in a relentless cycle of hypocrisy and disillusionment. Undoubtedly, there are still genuine and virtuous souls scattered throughout this chaotic existence, their goodness a flickering light in the shadows of pervasive cynicism. However, their presence often seems to diminish in the face of an overwhelming tide of negativity.

Does anyone else resonate with these reflections? Am I alone in grappling with this bewildering realization, feeling as though I am navigating a world filled with contradictions and moral ambiguities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ghetjc/the_hypocrisy_of_judgment_a_reflection_on_human/,11/1/2024 20:17,6,0,2,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

 Have you all noticed the growing extremism in various parts of Nepal? I just watched the popular media person podcast, Mr. Biswa Limbu podcast, where he had guests who are actively promoting extremism in various parts of Country. Their direct frustration towards all Brahmin and Chhetri, their culture and religion is genuinely frustrating for me. Although I don't currently live in Nepal and belong to the western part of Nepal, where I never had limbu, Rai, tamang  friends, I developed a sense of insecurity specifically towards Limbu, Rai and  Tamang people. I know this is wrong and can triggered them but it's a real feeling looking at the majority people opinions on tiktok and other socail media like instragram,facebook. Also, It would be unfair to focus only on the Mongol National Organization(MNO), Hindu extremism, Christian extremism and muslim extremism have also been rapidly increasing. The recent case in Nepalgunj, banke has deeply disturbed me.

19d0nz7,Do not accept mediocracy.,"This is an expression of frustration and concern, not intended as a rant or to incite violence. I believe that as Nepalese citizens, we have become accustomed to mediocrity, and it's crucial to voice our dissatisfaction with various issues without resorting to extreme measures like civil unrest. 

I feel we should let the people in power know that we are unhappy about many things around us. We are NOT under Rana Regime anymore and neither is this North Korea where we get happy with whatever we get and it is better than nothing. Majority of people are educated and if we want the coming generation to stay back or return back to Nepal we should all stop accepting mediocracy in my opinion. It would be the first of many steps and something we can all contribute to. the first thing I DO NOT want to listen is ""नेपाल होनी"", ""नेपालमा यस्तै त होनी"", ""यति भए पनि रहेछ/भयो नेपालमा"". I understand we are an underdeveloped country and have designated budget/ projects every year but that does not mean we accept whatever is thrown at us. What actually is being done needs to be more transparent and definitely needs calling out, Accepting mediocrity, especially when it comes to issues like infrastructure, education, and healthcare, may also hinder the progress and development of our country.

Things we should NOT accept

1) The roads. I swear to the god the roads are terrible. This is definitely not how the highways should look like. Roads you use everyday (galli tira), or major roads like UN Park tira ko bato, balkumari to jadibuti inside ko bato. Who the fuck constructed these roads? Who approved these projects? I am 23 and have no idea about roads and their construction, but I can guarantee I could provide a better functioning road with all the same resources. Solution: take pictures of the roads where you feel the standard has not been met, post it online and a transparent questioning to the concerned authority about who took the project and who accepted the results. Recorded conversations to the concerned authority about the repairing of them holes. (One way near chyasal ground has more holes than the black topped pitch and 100s of people use it every single day, why do we not say/do anything?)

2) Infrastructure of Sports. I don't ever want to hear ""Source Force लगाएर छिरेको"". Fuck Nepotism and it has no place in sports. We don't have facilities for sports and I cannot believe we do not any one saying anything. All people talk about is while taking sips of tea in a tea shop about how we've failed in sports. We should provide ideas and receive feedbacks transparently to the concerned authority about how to make Dashrat Rangasala better, where else can stadiums be built, what other sport should be given more coverage and priority. I don't think we can see instant results can be seen in any sport but a foundation should be built. People don't aspire to a sports person anymore. Everyone wants to go abroad and it is really sad this has happened.

3) Tribhuvan University. TU is shit and I think this is common knowledge. The Word ranking is terrible, the system is awful and the education provided is outdated and somehow people expect youngsters to stay in Nepal. The condition of education in Nepal is laughable. Exams never happen timely (heard someone gave their first year exam when they were in their third year) ; results are published so late that people actually complete other courses before their undergraduate degrees are given and don't even get me started on the content taught. TU should be scrutinized and the dean should be held responsible. Question should be asked.

4) Hospitals. I've seen so many doctors go abroad because it is literally unworkable in Nepal. Literally. When they see the facilities they get abroad, why would anyone want to come back? Why would anyone want to work at 30-40k a month when they've paid a minimum of 42 lakhs as tuition fees? You go to a hospital, you don't even know what to expect, this is why people who can afford medical care abroad never get it done here. I will go in depth if people actually read this post.  


5) Pls don't get me started on laws of Nepal. If I go to prison for this I'd expect you guys to not accept this as a violation of my freedom to speech. We cannot accept whatever the people in power want as a fucking law. This definitely needs calling out. 

I advocate for constructive action, such as documenting and sharing images of substandard roads, promoting fair practices in sports, providing ideas for improving sports facilities, scrutinizing and questioning the functioning of Tribhuvan University, and addressing issues in the healthcare system. It's crucial to foster a culture of accountability and transparency. While I discourage violent actions, I support respectful and assertive communication to make authorities aware of societal shortcomings. We should be as respectful as possible and make the government aware of these lacking in the society and that we will not accept mediocracy. If ignored and the government/ people with authority show complacency violent actions should be taken if necessary to address these issues and push for positive change. They will not like it when we take matters in our hand however I am very optimistic about this.

For now I've thought about starting with roads and making the government aware of all of these shitty roads and demand instant change. If you think this is a good idea we can open any social media account and share image/ video of unacceptable, below par roads that you use and tag the concerned authority. We also publicly confront the concerned authority be it ward office, municipality office, district office, or the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport. Then we see what changes can be brought and do they actually listen to people. For them to listen we need to speak and I think we speak in the way we know how; via social media. Not everyone needs to start a rally, or crowd maitighar mandala.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/19d0nz7/do_not_accept_mediocracy/,1/22/2024 17:13,28,0,16,"Nepali, Roman & English",0,1,1,0,0,2
138uv6e,Why does no one talk about import tax of vehicle in nepal?,"We all know the amount of money we pay to buy a vehicle but is it really worth it? Being a average person living in Nepal a vehicle is almost a basic necessity to have. Mostly for people who have to travel to work and such. Like public transportation is an option but we can't always rely on them. And as an middle class family man almost all our life time savings go to fulfill just that one necessity i.e to but that one vehicle. I travel at least 2 times every day on a bus from home to office and office to home. And traveling from bus has made me frustrated. I travel on pathao sometimes but i can't always afford pathao. So i was planning to buy a bike but the price is so much that i can't afford. 

My some questions are 

why so much import tax? We pay so much but still the roads we travel is untravelable (you know what i mean)

Is government taking advantage of our necessity to put so much tax on imports? Like (jasari ni kinihalxan 200 300% tax rakhdimna)

18c8tw5,How to be satisfied with your height?,"The thread is about insecurity. Out of nowhere I found myself becoming insecure about my height and now I don't know what to do.

Now before you start attacking me with ""Nepal ko average height is 5'4 why are you complaining"" and etcetera, I want to clarify that I have been telling myself that and trust me, it's not working.

As has been with my past rants, this one will have a tl;dr at the end as well.

Now I am by no means a midget. I am 176 cm which is squarely the average male height (in the US). I am not trying to downplay anyone who might be shorter by making this post, it is merely my subjective experience I'm trying to share here.

Until like grade 7, I used to be among the shorter kids in my class. All guys and girls, save few, were taller, but I naturally didn't think anything of it. Height was something I never bothered to check until a lot later. I hit puberty and started growing till grade 10. At the age of 15, I reached my peak. Since then, it has been half a dozen years with no growth whatsoever. Until the end of grade 12, I hadn't really measured myself properly and upon self measurements, I led myself to believe I was 5'11. The delusion was unfortunately short lived as after grade 12, I joined entrance preparation when I went to Kathmandu.

During my time there, I had a friend, we had prepared online (this was back during the covid era) and we decided we'd walk to the institute together, as I lived in her route to the building. I used to live with my cousins. While I wasn't one to give two fuqs about height even then, one of my cousins (who is a bit shorter) told me that the girl I was walking with was tall, close to my height. Up until then, that thought had never crossed my mind, but after that happened, during each walk I'd notice the tall stature. It got me intimidated to the point I once brought it up during a conversation to realize she was 5'7 or 5'8. Then it dawned on me that I maybe was shorter that I once believed I was.

It wasn't anything bad until I joined campus though. After joining up, I immediately found myself noticing people's heights a lot more than I used to do before. I got measured up at a health camp to finally know my actual height. I don't give much care to how tall guys are, because naturally I wouldn't want to be the tallest guy out there (too many health risks, I spent a couple days researching about height at some point). But when I see a woman who is close or more in stature than me, I can't help but feel uneasy. It's like my intuition wants me to be taller than the woman I walk by.

And before you start bashing me based on this, I never intended for any of this to happen. I WANT to be just like the other guys on this, not having a care at all. But I beat myself up everyday internally because unlike the other guys who notice a girl's face, body, or god forbid even b00bs/a$$ but I only notice their height(???). And as stated previously this doesn't apply to any guy I might walk by, but for some reason I can't treat this illness that affects specifically my perception of women.

Okay enough of that now I must have tried SOMETHING to counteract this and maybe identify the reasons behind it right? After a few talks with myself and scouring the web for any articles relating to this, I figured out it was an outcome of the following:

&#x200B;

1. Height is one of the few things you CANNOT change about yourself naturally (disregarding the surgeries), unlike your facial structure, fat percentage, muscle strength, vocal tone or any other insecurities out there.
2. Irrational competitiveness, since my brain somehow considers height as a metric to someone's level in the society. It might be because height, money, etc are quantifiable and can be explained objectively while other features of a person like attractiveness are more or less subjective in nature.
3. Me assuming I was taller than I actually was and then later realizing, triggering a mild PTSD
4. Me only growing for \~2 years during puberty, not enough when seen in retrospect or comparing subconsciously
5. My infatuation with leaving the country and maybe going to the US, thus making me consider myself just average even though for the context of Nepal it is not
6. My subconscious being unwilling to adapt to the fact that it's okay for people to be taller since a minority boasting a greater height wouldn't affect my livelihood in the slightest.

Now I know what the underlying issues are, but what I'm frustrated about is how I'm failing to find a solution that would make me less naive in this regard. I don't feel insecure about anything else. I don't care what people think about my looks, my voice, my hair, tastes and anything else.

Though I sometimes think it might have been different if I was taller, maybe 6'4 (nah prolly like 6). But then again it's not a solution right now. The solution is acceptance. I have been trying to find ways to move on. I tried to put myself on exposure therapy, and maybe hang around tall people to get that thought away but so far I haven't found much tall (esp. female) people I could hang around with to alleviate this unnecessary burden.

It might be solved once I get the exposure I'm looking for, in some other country, hopefully the US. But then again I'm not a 100% sure how effective that would be. At one point I thought maybe I should go to a therapist(??) but with the not-so-affordable charges and a chance to feel even worse or be ridiculed, is why I don't plan to share this to anyone irl.

If you or anyone you know has unfortunately experienced anything remotely similar, please shed light on how you/they were able to combat this. Please also leave any advice which might possibly help me get ""healthy"" again. But while doing so, please don't disregard that I have become this person **against the best of my intentions.**

I hope it goes away soon.

**tl;dr:** *Not so short but is scared of women same height or taller for some reason. Pathetic*

rv385a,"It is time to stand up against Private Schools for their ""English-Only"" rule.","Greetings everyone, 

Those of us who have studied in Private or Boarding Schools in Kathmandu Valley and other places of Nepal must have come across a rule that is widely known for disallowing conversation in Nepali, i.e., Speaking in English only.

In my opinion, this is one of the worst rules a school can ever implement. It not only makes it so stupid but also makes it a national crime. Let us talk about it below.

>**Nepal,** officially the **Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal** ([Nepali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language): सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल), is a [landlocked country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlocked_country) in [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia).  Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, and multi-cultural state, with [Nepali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) as the official language. ([More Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal))  
>  
> The [2011 National census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Nepal_census) lists 123 languages spoken as a mother tongue (first language) in [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal). Most belong to the [Indo-Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages) and [Sino-Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages) language families. 

As you can see, we are a multi-lingual country, which basically means an average person can speak more than 1 language. We have the freedom to convey our thoughts to any language we wish to in each regional language. This promotes diversity as each community can preserve their culture and their language, however, most of them are unified by the Nepali language. 

Even in the case of festivals and holidays, we follow the Bikram Sambat calendar and act accordingly. All of this relates to one thing and that is we mostly follow our country's trends in deciding official matters. 

Now imagine, Nepali, the language we use to communicate with others, is suddenly restricted, and instead, we have to speak a foreign language completely, which is not even native to our country. How would that make you feel? Moreover, does it make sense?

Majority of the private schools and academies situated in Kathmandu valley restrict students from speaking in Nepali or any other regional language. The reason they provide is mostly

1. It is an English boarding school so English is the primary language.
2. It will help you communicate with foreigners easily.
3. It is a modern language.
4. You are already speaking domestic languages, so there's no need to focus on it much.

But what if someone does not want to follow this rule? 

For them, only 1 thing lies ahead: Punishment, which can range from:

1. Monetary punishment or Fines. (NRP 10, 20, etc)
2. Written punishment. (Writing a few lines on paper that you will always speak in English)
3. Scolding
4. Not being able to attend classes
5. Parents are called
6. Suspension or Expulsion 

Yes, Suspension does happen.

In the school I studied from, we were given such embarrassing and stupid punishments for not speaking in English, which was something to remember. It not only made us frustrated but also angry.  I still clearly remember the times when our principal used to shout at us in the morning assembly and give us actual threats which said, ""If I find anyone not speaking in English, I will personally have them kept outside my office. Were they to repeat, it will call for a suspension."" Such a bold statement was made by none other than the Principal of a large school. Not only this, every teacher was told to enforce this rule strictly. While some teachers were lenient, some teachers acted as some sort of Police Officers that would scold you for a simple mistake harshly. They would embarrass us in classrooms, corridors, and also in the buses. It was an actual nightmare and we were treated as war criminals just for speaking in Nepali.

I am sure the majority of you have similar stories to tell, and I very well understand we could not do much to prevent it. Due to this horrific rule, the Nepalese youth have found themselves to be comforted by the English language. They are able to speak in English fluently and also enjoy media in English, in the form of songs, subtitles, movies, novels, etc. All at the cost of not being able to read a single line in Nepali correctly. We are finding ourselves to be struggling to read and understand the words of our own nation's language.

Thankfully, majority of the politicians are old and have rejected adopting the Gregorian Calendar and to give speeches in English, which has still guaranteed our freedom to use Nepali freely. But are we certain that such a thing will continue till the future? Only time can tell. 

Those who impose this rule cannot reason with themselves that they have fallen into a sort of western ideology, where if a person cannot speak English fluently, they cannot be classified as a literate person. 

But, there are countries out there that have rejected this ideology and take pride in their own language. Notably East Asian countries: China, Japan, and Korea. One look at these countries and anyone can say that nobody has to speak in English only to be successful. Anyone who works hard for their country and takes pride in it can be much more successful.

I guess I went out of topic for a bit, but my main point is, we should stand up against all the boarding schools in Nepal that don't allow students to converse in Nepali. Not only in Kathmandu but the entire nation.  If we fail to do this now, the Nepalese youth will continue to be excellent in speaking in English but will lack a lot of Nepali vocabulary. 

We should collectively start highlighting this issue among our peers, family members, politicians and most importantly take the support of the Media to share this throughout the country. Without standing up ourselves, we cannot protect our language.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/rv385a/it_is_time_to_stand_up_against_private_schools/,1/3/2022 14:43,39,0,55,English,0,1,0,0,0,2

1fo8e10,"Daughter of Nepali father and Foreign mother, Unable to get Nepali citizenship.","My mom's brother (my mama) fled to Bhutan with his friends at a young age to work in a coal mine. After many years, my mom and her other brothers managed to get in touch with him and arranged for his return, providing accommodation. He came back with his wife (maiju), who is of Nepali origin but Bhutanese, and their 24-day-old daughter. Maiju didn’t have any identification or official documents when they entered Nepal through the Kakarbhitta checkpoint via India.

A few years later, my mama applied for Nepali citizenship in his village, which he easily obtained since he had five siblings, his father, and other relatives in the village to verify his identity. Additionally, his official birth record was in the village. Over time, they had another child, a son. Their daughter is now 20 years old. Throughout all these years, my mama never thought it necessary to secure documentation for maiju, so she remains undocumented in Nepal. However, he did manage to register the birth of their daughter, though I’m unsure if their son’s birth was registered.

They’ve been living in Kathmandu for several years now, with migration papers from their village. The daughter is now of age to apply for citizenship, but since they can’t verify her mother’s identity due to the lack of documents, her application has been rejected multiple times, both at the ward and District Administration Office. Despite my mama’s best efforts, they’ve had no success in getting her citizenship.

She is currently in class 12, and the situation is becoming increasingly frustrating. Without citizenship, she can’t open a bank account, consider studying abroad, or access many opportunities. It feels like a dead-end, as maiju cannot return to Bhutan to obtain documents because, under the law, she is considered a foreigner living in Nepal without a visa.

Has anyone encountered or heard of a similar situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1fo8e10/daughter_of_nepali_father_and_foreign_mother/,9/24/2024 9:29,1,0,0,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

When I got here I found that he is no more the same person at all, all the household chores was on his little bro’s shoulder, he would give no f\*\*k about that any more. He was drastically changed, he remained unchanged by my coming. I found He treats his own brother so harshly making him do everything for him, I been generous to  little brother treating him like my own bro, taking him out for snacks and sharing meals, even when I had financial constraints. However, I feel unappreciated and have noticed that the little brother is not very considerate. Despite my efforts, he does not reciprocate my kindness that much I don’t know why, I have done many things for him, since he is unemployed he does not have to partake in room’s expenses and I have not complained about it to his brother also because I take it lightly and think it’s all good .All the expenses we split on half.

I felt really sick because of gastric issues and asked this little brother to get me some water. He initially refused and started reminding me about my turn. I reminded him of how I've taken care of him when he was sick in the past. He finally brought the water half-heartedly but continued to be on his phone and till aroudn 8pm, my gastric was hitting me hard so I had to start doing chores realizing he will start it after he fades up watching youtube shorts.

I was already feeling down because I had to argue with him just to fetch some water which only takes barely 2 min. It's frustrating because he's physically capable, it’s not that he is physically not-abled or some  but avoids doing chores when his turn is over. When he didn't start making dinner by 7:40, I went out to buy veggies and started doing the dishes myself. Finally he came reluctantly to take charge.

Our parents don't talk to each other, but we talk to each other parents with no problems because of that I am not being able to make a decision of moving out because I am scared it might distant our family’s relationship even hugely which I don’t want I always feel we all have to maintain niceness to each other and we need to live in harmony with each other but things doesnot seem such for us. However, when it comes to household chores, his brother doesn't want to help, even when I'm sick. Lately, even his little brother, who used to help, is giving me an  attitude. As far ar his brother is concerned, I can understand he might think I'm well-off and shouldn't do these tasks, but when I'm sick, I feel like I deserve care and support.

Even he and I  both get sick, his brother doesn't seem to care because he is a high standard dude, and just goes to work doesnot even ask that much about our wellness because he thinks it might make him to do household chores and he might need to stay at room taking care of us, outwardly every one thinks we r living in harmony in room splitting all the responsibility but it’s not like that at all.it’s not that he doesnot give a s\*\*t about anyone he does, he calls for every other hour to his gf if she falls sick, its just brothers that he feels no compassionate about. I'm starting to feel like I should move out, but I'm scared it might escalate the situation and strain our relationships with both families.

1h8naud,Struggling to Find a Room in Kathmandu Need Advice & Suggestions,"Hey everyone,

I've been searching for a room in Kathmandu for over 19 days now, both online and offline, but haven't had any luck so far. The process has been more challenging than I expected. To make matters worse, I almost got scammed during my search.

I've tried using popular rental platforms, asking around locally, and checking social media groups, but nothing has worked out yet. It's starting to feel pretty frustrating.

If anyone has any tips, trusted contacts, or knows of available rooms, I would be super grateful. Also, if you have advice on how to avoid scams in the process, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!

After a few days, following the review of my application, I received a message stating, ""Your vaccination center is in Surwarsi municipality. You have selected the wrong vaccination center.""



I corrected the information, although I was confident I had not been vaccinated in that municipality. When I entered Sunwarshi municipality, I received another notification after two days stating, ""Your vaccination center is Sundarharincha. You have selected the wrong vaccination center."" I then corrected it to Sundarharincha, which is the correct one.



It has been almost a month now, and the portal still says: ""

fdlymi,Is Corona virus already around us?,"Even after many weeks of Corona outbreak in China and the whole world panicking, we didn't even have a checking setup at the airport. People were freely entering Nepal directly from China. There was a news that even Indians were using the route through Nepal because India had started keeping people coming from China in quarantine while they could travel freely through Nepal. A recent news says a Spanish man who had visited Nepal has died and when the body was tested, it had Corona Virus. So, to think that the virus is still away from us is questionable. Then, why hasn't the number of reported cases increased? Its because we haven't reported at all. 

Now some facts about the Corona Virus which are against the general opinion:

- The Corona virus isn't as scary as it has been portrait. The first and only reported Nepali person infected with Corona was cured easily with normal treatment and now living healthy. If you aren't 60+ aged, then you have less than 1% chance of getting seriously ill(depending on your age and present health condition) by the virus.

- Corona Virus cannot live in temperature above 37°C for 2 hours(edited) out from their host i.e animals. 
{ source-https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.businesstoday.in/lite/story/novel-coronavirus-rising-temperatures-india-keep-deadly-virus-at-bay/1/396216.html } So, once the hot season arrives, the virus is bound to be ineffective. The same reason is why it hasn't spread in the african countries as other epidemics in past had spread. African countries are the most poorly prepared, yet they have the least cases.

- A paper mask cannot protect us from the virus. The normal mask we use is a surgical paper mask which has nearly no effect on Corona Virus. Corona virus are relatively big in size and they don't travel in air live other airborne viruses. Covid-19 spreads when an infected person coughs and transfers to person in front of him, or when he/she touches something and leaves the virus there. The mask that can protect us is the N-95 mask, which also isn't the right measure as its becomes difficult to breathe and very uneasy with that mask on us. So, mask isn't a solution at all. The best solution is, wash hands properly as it travels from our hand to mouth or nose, and avoid contact with the infected person which doesn't seem possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/fdlymi/is_corona_virus_already_around_us/,3/4/2020 23:31,72,0,51,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

You think this is not here yet (1 case aside)? We have 175 from the epicemter yet all are neg? TOTAL bs! - how is this even possible when a guy that met a friend that lunched with someone who had tea with an infected is going on in the west???!!!

Listen up -

This is here in Nepal and ravaging the communities we all live in but going un-diagnosed  cos it is all 'seasonal flu'! , same in India tbf!  Only a very few cases can be tested and barely any will be tested in Nepal! 

Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc etc will all be the untested victims of this til it is too late and we are mostly wiped out cos unlike China we can NEVER implement these mechanisms to halt the spread and so the poor people of Asia will be the stat that the west relate to when in 1yrs time try to find a solution to this..

I am seriously disturbed by this!!  I, am a UK citizen and can leave anytime, it REALLY bothers me that most cannot and so are left to the false W.H.O devises that only further their agenda etc!

Please believe me - this is a Global pandemic, engineered for a purpose and i feel that Nepal somehow feel immune to this due to the govt blocking of real data?

Meh - i hope this resonates with of few of you and you can somehow bypass the bs or stick it out etc?? I am gonna hunker down and ride it out here so if and when we can meet - celebrations n new plans for the future !!

jppgzr,Tragic experience of Corona,"TLDR

Father and daughter lost life due to corona in matter of two days. There is no one to console remaining family member as they are also infected by corona virus and are insecure about their health condition.

&#x200B;

Around 7-8 days ago, my brother's father in law was diagnosed with covid-19 virus. He developed symptom of high fever and even fainted. As soon as possible, he was rushed to hospital and was admitted there. Just 3 days ago he passed away. All family members were checked for covid-19. Among 4 siblings, 3 of them were infected. From them, other family members were also infected. Around 10-12 people of same family got infected in total.   


Sudden demise of 53 year old father was tragic enough, there was race to protect other members of the family. Among those siblings, my sister in law's maili didi developed some symptoms. She was rushed to hospital at 3 in the morning. At 2 pm she was about to be discharged. But tragedy struck, she suddenly passed away at 2:30 pm at the age of 29, yesterday. Just 2 days after her dad's death.

Now there is rush to protect youngest son, around 18 years old and other sister's husband as they have developed some symptoms. Even their daughter of 2 years old is infected. It is a mess. There is no one to give shoulder to cry on as most of them have been tested positive. It really hard to lose two family members at once. I cannot imagine the condition of mother in law. We cannot do much, not even give her company in this great tragedy. All we can do is try to prevent from doing further damage to the family by protecting infected one.

Within matter of two days, corona has left ugly scar which will never recover. We have realized this thing is monster and must be dealt properly. Little carelessness can fuck up entire family.

Did we really controlled corona or are we being deceived? Less tests are being done everyday.  From my personal experience, it is extremely difficult to find hospital bed if something serious happens. Yet no one is complaining or media is not playing any role.

There was case a day ago out of ktm I guess, he also died the same way and his sample was sent after he died for the test. Came negative. 

Probably this case will also come negative.

If you suspect you have corona infection, will you trust to go to hospital, to get isolated, leave there without getting any treatment?

How the fuck can people die just from fever? Isn't hospital there to prevent it, to save people?

Seems like people are dying all over the country from symptoms like corona but test result is negative.

I'm not sure if this the right subreddit to post this question on but I didn't find a better one.  
In March and April 2022 I have some spare time and I would love to use this time to go to Nepal and do a retreat in a buddhist monastery/temple. I found it quite hard to find information on which places you can do a retreat despite corona. I think the most popular monastery is Kopan but they are closed for short time retreats. Some other monasteries I found were also closed, for some others again I couldn't find any information.

So I would be very thankful if somebody has more information regarding a possible monastery/temple in Nepal where I could do a retreat (in the best case for around one month)!

If god forbid even 500 people contract the virus tomorrow, there aren't enough respirators to go around in the CAPITAL city of Nepal.

Oh btw! Have you been to the new China town of the country, Thamel? The place is filled with Chinese and I can bet my life that the government allowed Chinese nationals to come in from China even after the initial spread. International workers and students are coming in from already compromised countries and get a fucking thermometer check to make sure its safe to enter. Tf is that all about.

n2kcn1,Missing the Corona's Point," 

Humanity is on addiction so it is failing to grasp the message of the global pandemic. Most of the world is still in the same mode that used to run human affairs around the world. The economy for every nation is more important than anything. Shall we remind all of humanity, it is the economy that is causing world destruction? 

Since industrialization began, the focus has been producing more and more goods, building more and more factories, roads, and infrastructure. This is obvious because it came from the West, the culture and civilization that is built on science and only the material world. All it has meant is that economic development is the way to go. What that has meant actually is to lessen physical labor and increase sensual pleasure. Humanity has thought that science is the only norm worth pursuing. 

What has been neglected is that human values and character are not worth anything anymore. It is not the quality and gravity of a person that is to be admired but the number of followers on Insta, Facebook, TikTok, etc. The thing to do is to be popular and participate in TV reality shows, become stars of movies and sports. That is why sports, television, and cinemas keep going on. Only today, I finally saw an outrage about the professional sports in India amidst the world's worst pandemic. 

📷  


I have been checking up on the Indian dance show called the ""Super Dancer"" and appalled to see that 4-year-olds are participating in the hopes to be stars. No one seems to realize that it is a corrupting force and will be destroying the lives of the children who are getting so much media attention on television during the show.  You could even argue that they are victims of a form of pedophilia. The children are made to dance to [sexually suggestive songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIbWZbgBkg0). They are praised for their expressions and movements that they have no understanding of. They are at such a critical formative stage of their lives, and their focus is to be famous. What are they going to be doing for the rest of their lives after the show season is over? Will they be able to handle the missing limelight? Not that easily. If they have been programmed with such a phony value, that is what they will be seeking all their lives. How possible is that going to be?

Corona is not going to go away. It is super smart, actually a lot smarter than human beings, and scientists. It has already busted the myth that the West has the best healthcare system in the world, or that they are better with their comfort-driven lifestyle. Corona has said, ""Bullcrap."" Corona will outsmart the scientific world. The law of nature is on its side, and the climate is also on its side. Guess what, the human mode of living is also on its side. 

Corona has already taught that any crowded event is a no-no. So, that should leave the professional sporting events, entertainment shows, and even the mass gatherings of parties and ceremonies should be the things of the past, just like virtual meetings becoming the new norms. So, the biggest industries that had actually little value to offer humanity, but reaped the highest chunk of reward, is actually not in the interest of human subsequent development. 

Money, economy, and unlimited desires and comfort are not the true pursuit of human life. The popularity contest like beauty pageants and modeling, petty politics in all the countries, the unchecked industrial production to satisfy the insatiable desires for gratification, are all contributing to lead humanity astray from the purpose why they are born here. 

We are now in a situation as preposterous as having a family member sick fighting for life in the ICU, and what we are bothered about is not the crisis but attending the birthday party of a friend. In the USA, racism is the issue at the top; in India election is sweeping through the country, and in Nepal, political contentions and tussle for power remain the hottest issue, even selling off the sovereignty of the nation itself just to hold on to the power. No one is re-evaluating the human course and coming challenges. 

If anything, humanity should have been reaccessing the norms and values. Kindness, compassion, and love for the planet, fellow humans, all living beings, and respect for mother nature should have been the way forward. First of all, putting a ceiling on desires is needed, not flaming them. Overcoming ego should have been a priority. 

Yet, Americans tend to continue gun violence unabated while trying to pick a fight with China. India seeks plans to be one up on China by aligning with the US. What about Nepal? It continues to rot with goons infesting every sphere of life. And oh yes, it plans to be the battleground in the upcoming fight targeting China. 

Corona is bringing it all out yet we continue to miss the point. Addiction is such a bad thing.

frrzlo,Can we make some useful graphics regarding Corona virus?,"Hi r/nepal. Firstly if there is already something like this please send it to me. My maternal uncle told me that someone nearby his village who came from abroad and had some fever was expelled by the village. Apparently the poor guy had to walk all the way to hospital and was denied treatment as well. There seems to be a lot of misinformation among people which are in some cases outright hurting common people. Having corona doesn't mean it's an end to all. Can we create some graphics providing useful information regarding what to do

1) how to avoid corona  

2) what are the symptoms and explaining that fever & coughs may not be corona but to be cautious.

3) what to do if you suspect you have corona

4) what to do if you have corona

evhxr5,On Novel Corona Virus and Nepal,"1. This (Link: [https://youtu.be/9afTl9z5JHQ](https://youtu.be/9afTl9z5JHQ)) is from the Official YT channel of Gates Foundation, uploaded in April 2018 and now unlisted (i.e. it won't appear as search result in YT).
2. This was prepared by Dr. Hao Hu and Bryan Ressler (Institute for Disease Modeling, IDM) for the Shattuck lecture delivered by Bill Gates. Source: a) [http://www.idmod.org/news/node/296](http://www.idmod.org/news/node/296)

b) [https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2018/04/Shattuck-Lecture-Innovation-for-Pandemics](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2018/04/Shattuck-Lecture-Innovation-for-Pandemics)

3. This simulation shows what would happen if a highly contagious and lethal airborne pathogen were to occur (obviously, this is not specifically about the Novel Corona Virus, nCoV-2019). Original Link: [http://www.idmod.org/node/295](http://www.idmod.org/node/295)

4. Several of the mainstream western media are referring to this simulation in their wrongly-titled articles and causing unwarranted fear-mongering. Example: [https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10814760/bill-gates-predicted-coronavirus-simulation-33-million-die/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10814760/bill-gates-predicted-coronavirus-simulation-33-million-die/)

With that said, now notice how the flu in the simulation originates from China and the third or fourth dot appears in Wuhan (the ground zero for nCoV). This may have mainly to do with some of the previous flu pandemics also originating from China.

(see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza\_A\_virus\_subtype\_H2N2#Asian\_flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H2N2#Asian_flu) )

Now notice how at the end of the six months of the simulation period, Nepal is the worst affected alongside India and Coastal China. I haven't found the variables they have considered for this simulation model but it certainly must have included distance and mobility from the assumed ground zero (maybe even governmental efficiency in curbing it in the face of epidemiological crisis?), state-wise health services, and economic status (GDP, per capita income) amongst others. Is this disconcerting?

**Edit 1:** 

Measures taken by Nepal are a) Sealing Rasuwagadhi border for 15 days starting Jan 29 (not a single case reported from bordering Tibet btw) 

Source:  [https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/nepal-china-rasuwagadhi-border-point-to-be-closed-for-15-days-from-wednesday/](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/nepal-china-rasuwagadhi-border-point-to-be-closed-for-15-days-from-wednesday/) 

b) Use of thermal scanner at TIA. This one seems inadequate as nCoV can be transmitted by asymptomatic people also as the incubation period is up to 14 days.

cwf980,My opinion about Rabi Lamichhane Phenomenon,"Post might be big and the stance im taking is not a popular one. But I am quite disappointed with how this issue has turned out. First of all, rabi was taken into custody regarding a suicide statement made by his coworker. Police found it was not a murder but was a suicide and there were not enough grounds for rabi to be incarcerated and he was released. That is how the law works, not just here but almost everywhere, police did their job and court did their job. And regardless of people demonstrating in streets or fighting over social media, this would have been the end result. Or he could not have even been taken into custody in first place if his lawyers had moved it to the supreme court(as someone pointed out in this subreddit regarding kanak mani case and shilpa-chhabiraj case). Just like everyone saying ""im disappointed with the people of nepal"", whenever the result is is against their personal support, i am also saying the same thing. 

First of all, to make things clear, i have watched many of his shows and i am quite entertained by his sensational style and  his aggression. But there was nothing heroic about Shalikram case and he didnot fight against any evil these 2 weeks and I honestly dont believe he was framed. Shalikram had depression due to finance and relationship and a grudge with rabi so he vented his anger. Thats it; no image of other person in shalikram's eyes in video, no one gave money to shalikram to say that, not related to shaktikhor issue, no thulo-manchhe carved a plan, no nothing. Shalikram wearing vest in video and wearing shirt while hung is equal to ""bam didi bahini ko ghar ko amba ko bot kaatiyeko"" in nirmala pant's case. If any thulo manchhe really wanted to get rabi off the turf, they would have done same thing as they did to Kumar Poudel. Some days ago he was murdered by the government and may be most of you dont even know about its occurrence. I have seen so much of shit in our country and in the whole world as well and I am disappointed in this age of information where truth is no more trendy and sensational. Although I think Rabi is not even closely as corrupted as Khum bahadur, but the celebration of yesterday was as pointless as when khum bahadur khadka was being released from jail. 

Nepal or also other south asian countries have the problem of people-worship. Hinduism doesnot have the stronghold as it does in india so we need to find a god to worship. every one who is or has been in power were once a deity and demonized just as they came to power. we always search for a person as, a savior, a messiah, but always we got disappointed. (As gagan thapa said, we require proper institution rather than proper leader but lets not go there as it would be off topic.) And besides, rabi leads a tvprogram that operates through sponsorship. On one hand, he is exposing a consultancy, while on the other he is advertising another. I saw a cobrapost sting operation where indian media were exposed for taking money and supporting a political party during election. That is what happens through sponsor-based media. You need money to operate and sometimes you need to compromise, overlook or even distort some information regarding your sponsors. just like kantipur jumped from ""tapaiko saabun ma boso chha news"" to ""xyz luga dhuney sabun jasma boso chhaina ad"". So i dont think ""sidha kura""(not ravi), can evade this constraint. I would not have worried if sidha kura was state-funded. People will lose their shit when i say this, but BBC, Al Jazeera are state-funded but not like gorkhapatra or radio nepal which is government ko tune bajne baasuri. Getting government to pay for you might be difficult so they can even start anonymous donation to operate, given the number of support, they can easily earn through that.

cpqizm,Advice regarding my study.,"I gave SLC in Nepal and after SLC I had to move to Europe (Portugal) with my parents. I had a dream of becoming theoretical physicist. I thought studying in Europe would give me more qualifications due to higher and advanced learning. But alas, I had to join highschool here. And high school here teach in Portuguese language and I didn't know it yet. Here, even if you failed two subjects but passed all you get promoted to another grade. In first year, I passed maths on my own, I also passed gymnasium and English on my own. I didn't passed physics on my own but in one of the physics test i excelled and got highest point in whole class. My physics teacher said that i deserve to go further because I'm talented in math and physics and my barriers is language only. I excelled in math so much that every other nepali that came in my school would be demeed good at mathematics by default. So my physics teacher gave me 11 point 1 point more than i needed to pass and hence i passed my 10th grade with only failing biology and philosophy. In 11 grade here we have national exam similar to SLC or SEE in Nepal. We have to give national exam of two subject out of three, bio, philosophy and physics. I gave for bio and physics and i failed it. Since i failed only two subject which was bio and physics i was promoted to 12th grade but i have to pass this two national exam to get through high school and get to university. In 12th grade we have national exam too. This time for math and Portuguese. Since i didn't know Portuguese i gave for PLNM which is for foreigners learning Portuguese. I passed math easily but hardly passed PLNM but i passed nonetheless. But now i have to give national exam for 11th grade too and i did this year and i failed again. To understand and elaborate in foreign language that too that of science is tough. Even Portuguese fail who am i not to. But i don't think i can pass it ever. I'm getting old and i wanted to study physics but i don't think my dream is going to be true. I only have temporary residencey. One of my friends was in same position as mine but he got citizenship and went UK to learn from 10th grade again. I do not have such freedom. My family also cannot afford expensive English teaching private school. I was planning to study in Norway because education is free and my uncle lives there. But inorder to get into university i need to pass high school which i cannot do here. And the things that's bothering me most is I'm getting old and i am just wasting my time. Do any one have any advice? It's bothering me a lot. So much so i thought about suicide too. I am having headaches and dizziness due to high blood pressure.

Everywhere, we have stress and a different kind of emptiness that is killing us inside.   Being clueless every morning on what I am going to do this day. The motive of this song is not to motivate anyone to continue being unemployed but to reflect the life that a general unemployed youth is living. Well, this song is about realizing that you are not the only one, and trust me, when the heart is happy, everything is okay. Just smile and live life to the fullest and wait for the moment.  Life will eventually take positive turns soon.

dcmkot,Regarding Collectivist Ideology and the apparent anger and frustration of Nepalese citizens.,"Are UML and Maoist responsible for the problems in Nepal or is this responsibility something that is transferred to whoever is in power? I remember when Sushil Koirala was the PM, people were saying the same things that they're saying to K.P. Oli to him. 
In the 2074 election, Maoists and UML got around 45 lakh votes( House of Representatives ). All these 45 lakh people are somehow uneducated, stupid,corrupt but somehow we being the ones that are vocal on social media are free from all that?? Is political instability strictly the fault of politicians or is it a common responsibility we must bear because we Nepalese never allow any party to carry out their designated years by pressuring the government regardless of who's in power? 

 The GDP, GDP per capita, GDP from agriculture, GDP from mining, GDP from Construction, GDP from Manufacturing are all on an incremental rate. While I do agree that many policies and actions of the government have been questionable, is it really that bad that we have to form groups and abuse the government and the leaders ? Do we really have to say such bad things and utter such vulgar language? Is our hatred really that fervent? And the ones who say that they are deeply upset with the government actions, do you speak for the labourers and lower middle class as well? Or do you speak for the decadent onlookers who  do not have a job, never had to pay taxes, are relying on your parents income to feed yourself that have never seen what it's like on the streets thus enabling you to vicariously commentate on the politics and abuse the leaders instead of actually doing a damn thing about yourself.

bczfti,New Year Moan:Got beaten up,"I along with two others friends were walking back home from Ozone Bar and Disco (Pokhara) this morning about 4 am. Suddenly, I heard a voice "" Mach\*\*\*\*, Baato chod"". I turned around to find a scooter coming behind us. Usually, I would have complied and given way to any vehicle on the road, if it was a horn instead of ""Mach\*\*\*\*"". But this morning, we gave up the way but it came upon me spontaneously to reply ""Mach\*\*\*"" with ""Mach\*\*\*"". Apparently, there were three pretty drunk guys in a scooter. They stopped right ahead of us and all of them came our way to confront. Well, not much of verbal confrontation though; they just started hitting us with their helmets. We managed to block most of the shots and returned the favor occasionally, but they were mostly in self-defense. We didn't want to end up in prison the first day of the year, so we just wanted it to end. But those guys were fucking relentless about beating us up to death. Anyhow, we managed to escape and later found out I received most of the blows; got bruised and bloodied.  Got home, got a shower and slept in pain. 

Well, new year couldn't have started better. My head still hurts and I hope I don't have a concussion. I did apologize to my friends though as things would not have gotten that way if I had simply controlled my anger and swallowed the ""Mach\*\*\*\*"".

aeak9x,Anyone realize that Nepali is a difficult language to master?,"All those lessons in Byakaran were in vain because we hardly ever use such formal structures. 

Also, we almost always incorporate english words even though there exists a Nepali word. 

Our degree of surprise and anger is based on how the word ""lamo"" is pronounced. 

Most Kriyapads have been shortened for ease. For eg. Gaathyo, dyathyo, marna gaathis?. Gareko hare becomes garya re. 

Slangs like ""bhutro, etro, kera, geda"" are very versatile, and can be used almost anywhere. 

Nepali sarcasm is clear and easily understood unlike English sarcasm which is mostly subtle. 

We do not have literal translation from English words like Please. Although, kripaya is please, but whoever uses it nowadays? 

Basically, i doubt Nepali can be learned through grammar only. 

Edit: Turns out it's the same for every other language, and that my post should've targeted how formal Nepali is gradually becoming obsolete.

e3gmb3,On Alcohol,"I don't drink. That is the way it has always been for me, and it is not a habit I want to get into either.

Growing up, my friends have almost always been quite similar to me in this regard and it has never been an issue.

Now however, don't know whether it is because of my friends changing or times changing, the fact that I don't drink has been hindering my social life (which is already hard for me to maintain as an introvert.) My friends often go out simply to get drunk, and it seems I can not attend any function now where I don't end up being the only one sober. I get uncomfortable when people around me drink, too. Feels very weird.

Things have gone to the extent where people tell me to ""learn to have some fun"" or ""move with the times"" quite frequently aajkal.

Not passing judgement on anyone else's pesonal choices, but this is all very frustrating for me. I thought drinking was the problem, not the other way around. (And let us not even get into smoking.)

e5oezz,(Spoilers) I just watched 'Joker' and it's so well made. Did you guys like (or hate) it? ......we live in a society puns inbound.,"I had been trying to isolate myself as far as possible from spoilers for this movie although I did hear that it was great. I watched it today and rather than the the origin story or the movie making techniques, the message stood out to me as brilliant.

The focus on mental health, societal issues and the gap between the poor and the rich  being a trigger for all the worst parts of a revolution / anarchism was so well encapsulated and a hot topic for today's world. Child abuse and PTSD are subjects thay fall under the radar always after a little uproar. 

I got chills when I was watching poor access to healthcare by a country's system letting societies most vulnerable down (that part where The Joker realises he was allowed to be adopted by an unstable parent, abused till he got severe PTSD and what seems to be like psychosis, then finally not given the appropriate care). I mean this is something that happens everyday, and people become really fucked up mentally because of it. Not everyone becomes a sadistic murderer like the joker but their health and the consequences of failed care are treated like they're worth nothing. It shouldn't.

Apart from psychiatric issues, that are not given much importance, just think of how women's health is a non-issue in Nepal. Reflecting on our country's issues I feel like everyone's patience is just tested everyday and maybe one day we'll see something a 100 times more violent than the maoist insurgency (unless things change drastically). I don't know, I fear that day.

What did you guys think about it?

dzfgzy,Did Gyanendra/Paras really kill Birendra?,"I was pretty young when the revolution happened. With all the slogans against Gyanendra and Paras, I believed these two people must be the worst people in this country maybe even worse as a blood sucking parasite or serial killers. Everybody believed they killed Birendra. But if you look back, they were just a bunch of puxxies.

  
1. I am an agnostic Hindu because of the condition I was born in.(lower- middle class upbringing, moving abroad for better life and opportunity). If I was born in a Royal family like them, I would probably believe I was the chosen one from God and be a fundamentalist Hindu. In Hindu Rajput(Royal family), it is totally fine to die for throne because basically thats what the Rajputs or Thakuris are born for. And what did Gyanendra do even when he had his god-brother as a powerful general in the Army? He just sat in his palace watching some politicians stripping him off powers and finally telling him you are no longer needed for this country.  
I mean come on, if I was in his position, I would rather kill and get killed when I believe whatever I am doing is rightful when I would have to answer the God.  
Do you really think a puxxy like this could have taken all the risk of killing the whole Royal family and his other brothers and relatives for something that he gave up so easily later in his life?

2. Look at Paras. Its not hard to comprehend this guy is mentally unstable. If he was in good standing, he could have easily claimed the throne when the first constitutional assembly was dissolved. But, he would rather choose to hang out with some hoes and openly consume drugs. 

Do you think some guy in his 30's(back then) who believed and still believes and acts like a teenager could have orchestrated the whole plan to kill the Royal family and come out clean?

3. Its been almost 19 years since the incident and 10 years since Gyanendra/Paras lost their power. Why hasn't anyone come upfront to say Gyanendra/Paras killed Birendra? Not even Shruti's husband who lost his wife and a thumb in the massacre?

bpcfo5,My life was almost fucked up today !!!,"  

It’s just been half an hour that everything has settled. But as I write this I am still breathing heavily and everything feels like a dream. Thought it will be something worthy to share.

Woke up at 10 today, straightly logged into my Coinbase account to check the unconfirmed transaction of $70 for some work I completed just yesterday. Transaction was confirmed, and my crypto portfolio was worth $70 more. Overall it was a good start and I was thinking some fun for the day. At around 12, got a call from friend. Said he had contact number of one man (weed farmer) and already talked to him, and asked if I wanted to go for a hunt. “What a day for the hunt”, that was the only thought in my mind. We met at Lagankhel and got into the bus for the place. It took around one and half hour to get there. It was a good place, I’d never been there before, hills around and my friend pointed me to one house at the hills. It was a good 20 mins walk from bus station. We went to the house, there were an elderly couple and their son maybe. We greeted them and *baje* told us to sit while *bajai* already had brought water bottle for us. It seemed like my friend knew them, he talked to *baje* about their earlier conversation over phone. “*Sakkyo babu aaba ta, thorai matrai baki xa yespali ko”,* and went inside. Just after a while, he was outside with a plastic bag full of weed, we took the bag and inspected, was around 400-500 grams and the flavor smell amazingly good. I haven’t thought of that much amount when he said *thorai matrai baki xa*, but it felt awesome. It was enough stock for 2-3 months or even more. My friend paid the amount, took out some weed from plastic and we start to make, we thought of separating the stuff from old leaves and those wood or stem whatever so it would be lesser amount for us to carry. Even *baje* was helping us and he asked his son to get *chilim* from inside. We smoked there, outside the house, looking at the hills around and talking about different topics. *Baje* told us about how the place was before and his stories with hippies. We were even offered food, *usineko makai and achar* on high felt better than anything I ate until now. We were already so high that I once thought I couldn’t walk from there. After a while we thanked them and departed from there, got into bus and back to room.

It was 5:30 when we got back to my room. We had planned to get to room, leave the bag and go for tea. After getting at room, I just threw the bag on bed, locked the room and we went for tea. I was still so high that my face felt internally deformed and talking normally was difficult. Stayed at one tea shop with Bagmati and sankhamul park on view, talked about how high we were and discussed the movies to watch later and some political scenarios going on around the world. 25-30 mins after, we walked back towards room and then everything changed.

We took a shortcut and it was a small alley. Just at the entering of alley, there were few policeman and people gathered and one women was complaining about something. I don’t know what I thought at that moment, I unknowingly spoke to an Inspector aside me, “*dai, chori ko case ko”?* In just milliseconds I realized that I’d put myself in trouble. He looked at me, he definitely looked shocked, said *“Ah ho, kasari thaha bhayo timlai”?* I’d already thought that I should play calm or its more trouble. I said, *“dherai jana jamma bhako dekhe, testai lagera sodheko”.* My friend was behind me, wearing a black mask, fully quite, I still don’t know what was going on his mind, will ask him later. I knew the Inspector definitely noticed my high eyes and said two guys on scooter snatched a gold necklace and purse from that women. He asked where we were some while ago and what we were doing. It was only me doing the talking with him, said we were out for a tea and also briefed him we were students in nearby reputed college. He asked for a card, but both of us didn’t carried it and by the way it was expired too. Just to get out of the situation, I talked about college and now it was getting us in trouble. Then he talked something with ASI and said its better they inspect my room once. We were just about to get into biggest trouble of our life, I was not worried about anything but the weed in room, just inside the bag over bed and it was not a small quantity. I didn’t have any knowledge regarding laws for someone to inspect the room and warrant things. I thought talking about those things will create even more problems. Instantly different ideas started coming at once, is running from here a better option? Should I take them to some other friend’s room? None of them seemed like working and I thought of getting bag out of sight as we get to room or even offering to pay the ASI who was to inspect our room. It was just 4-5 minutes way from there, I was trying to get friendly with the ASI and my friend, for 15 minutes he was in complete mute mode. We got to the room, weed had no effect on us now. Opened the room, we all three get inside and 1st thing ASI notices is the goddamn bag on the bed. The guy didn’t seem to care about the carpets and walked straight to bag. What I had in mind then was, I have around 100,000 in savings and will offer him all in worst case scenario. He opened the bag and his facial expression told he smelled something. He asked “*k ko basna ho yesto”?* I thought what, the guy is talking about smell? And instantly I and my friend saw the empty bag but there was good fragrance of weed. I was damn shocked and made a thing instantly “*aasti gau jada buale bakhra lai khwauna bag ma rakhera lyaunubha raixa kataibata, dhunai bhyaxaina aailesamma”.* I took out that expired college card and gave it to him. He looked at the card, handed it to me and looked around the room, more than 30 empty beer bottles were lying in one corner. He said nothing more, gave a quick smile, and left the room. We still didn’t have the idea how bag was empty but we were out of the biggest trouble faced until.

Instantly, I asked my friend to call *baje*, in hope we could find something. He called, and while he talked on the phone, the smile on his face was incredible. After he hung up the call, he told that we only smoked there and never kept remaining stuff on our bag. *Baje* said he had called my friend but couldn’t get connected. It was such a wonderful feeling, I didn’t know who to thank for this. I remembered god, that baje, my parents, that Inspector, my friend and ASI all at the same time. I still don’t know what would have happened if we were caught with fucking half-a-kg of weed, just fine or some couple years in prison but either way my life will have been fucked up and also Police criminal record. Now, after I post this I will have a talk with my friend about the situation and what he was thinking the whole time.

Guys, if you smoke pot or carry it, please be extremely cautious about it. I’ve learnt a lesson today, the hard way. As I enter this post, I’m going to get a drink for us and will drink for GOD today.

I want to ask another thing, is it safe that we go to collect the weed tomorrow? Or are we marked and might be followed by someone? They even know my room.

&#x200B;

1kpae1b,"Anxiety, fear, and concentration issues are ruining my life—has anyone else been through this?","I know this might not be the right place to post this, but I’m genuinely struggling and don’t know where else to turn.

I’ve been feeling extremely stressed, anxious, and constantly afraid about the future. I often overthink past conversations—even when they weren’t bad at all. I believe I also have social anxiety, because I find it hard to talk to people, especially strangers. When I’m around people I know, it’s much easier.

I also have trouble concentrating and staying focused. I think I may be experiencing symptoms similar to ADHD.

A little background: I was on antidepressants for 2 years. Under the guidance of my doctor, the dose was gradually reduced and eventually stopped. During that time, I felt much more confident and emotionally stable.

But now, even small situations trigger intense fear and anxiety. I’m doing my best—I meditate and go for daily walks (30 to 60 minutes)—but nothing seems to help consistently. Sometimes I feel depressed too.

My career and education are suffering. I’m a bachelor’s student, but I’m struggling badly. My anxiety, overthinking, and lack of focus are making it hard to study or plan anything for the future.

About six months ago, I visited a new psychiatrist. I told him I was experiencing symptoms like ADHD (which isn’t really recognized or diagnosed properly here in Nepal). He suggested starting antidepressants again for two weeks to see how it goes.

I bought the medicine—but because of my past experience, and fear of being judged by friends and society—I ended up throwing it away. I tried to move on without it, but now things are just getting worse.

Every day feels like a battle. Constant fear. Regret. Pressure. I feel like everything is going wrong, and I don’t know how to fix it.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any suggestions, I would really appreciate your thoughts. Thank you for reading.

So, yedi hajur haru sanga experience xa, being with some really good psychologist who makes you feel safe, and give genuine advice. Do suggest me. 



Thankyou so much.

1iuqco6,Need more attention to this,"Yo incident chai KUSMS ko psychiatry department ko first-year resident ko suicide attempt ko barema ho. The resident took 20 tablets of Flexon and ended up in the ICU. But this isn’t an isolated case—this department has a long history of bullying, harassment, and a toxic environment created by professors and seniors. Because of this, every year, residents either drop out or, in extreme cases, attempt suicide. Yet, no one has been held accountable. Can you believe it? Even the Professor of Psychiatry made a shocking, insensitive comment, saying, ""20 ota ko satta 40 ota tablet khayera marna khoje ni kei hudaina, jhundera marne vaye ma afai dori dinchu."" Seriously, how can someone who’s supposed to care about mental health say something like that?

This whole situation shows how broken the system is. Institutions like KUSMS and others keep sweeping student issues under the rug. They don’t take mental health seriously, and no one is ever held responsible. Medical students are suffering in silence, and it’s high time we do something about it. We need to demand accountability—maybe even revoke the licenses of those who enable this toxic culture. The medical fraternity and the public need to come together, raise their voices, and push for real change. Hope matra garera basda hudaina; we need to act now before more lives are lost. Let’s talk about this, share it, and make sure those in power can’t ignore it anymore.

To name and shame: 
Dr. Deepak Kunwar 
Dr. Ajay Rijal 
Dr. Barsha Shrestha

Also people cannot come out against them directly as they are really scared to face their wrath if the identity is known.

Also they had the audacity to bring out that statement (2nd slide)

TLDR:
A psychiatry resident at KUSMS attempted suicide by taking 20 Flexon tablets. The department has a history of bullying and toxic behavior, but no action has been taken. Shockingly, a professor said, ""If you want to die, take 40 tablets or I’ll give you a rope.""

1jiefjy,Anyone who is suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)? Need someone to work through self-led DBT sessions,"Hi, I've been diagnosed with BPD for quite a few years now. I wanted to connect with individuals who have the same condition as me, and would love to do self-led therapy/reflective worksheets aimed at helping elevate the symptoms of BPD. If you or your loved ones suffer from the same personality disorder and are in their late adulthood (27+) and would like to actively participate in self-help led Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and art activities is welcome to connect with me. This will be online based. 

**Why?**   
I want to help myself and I want to help others who have gone through similar experiences.

  
**A bit of information on BPD (according to DSM-V-TR):**    

\- Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition characterized by *pervasive patterns of instability in mood, self-image, and interpersonal relationships,* as well as marked *impulsivity.* 

*- Fear of abandonment* and *chronic feelings of emptiness* further compound the complexity of this disorder. 

\- *Splitting* is common, viewing others as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" from moment to moment. Individuals with BPD can become dependent on others but also have dramatic shifts in their feelings when feeling abandoned or disregarded. etc

[Find more about this here: ](https://www.mredscircleoftrust.com/storage/app/media/DSM%205%20TR.pdf)(Page-1003)   
\---------------------------------------------------------

**A bit of information on DBT:**

\- Dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) is a highly structured psychological therapy that combines mindfulness practices with concrete interpersonal and emotion regulation skills based on cognitive behavioral therapy. *DBT aims to change behaviour and enable the patient to tolerate distressing feelings by skill-building in emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interpersonal behavior.*

\- DBT is well studied and has been proven to be a highly efficacious tool in improving symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal tendency, impulsivity, mood instability as reviewed in a [systematic review ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10896753/)in 2024. However, self-led DBT sessions have yet to be tested for its effectiveness.

1jct6vp,"Alcoholic parents, suggestions and advice needed for management","Namaste,

My mother is alcoholic and every time she drinks which is almost everyday, there is a huge fight between my parents for no reason. This has been a problem for however long I am able to remember. I have put her in a rehab once but that did nothing. I am not in Nepal right now so she has had even more freedom as no body is there to tell her not to drink. My father has been a depression patient and has been taking anti depressants for so long. They call me in the middle of the fight when I am at work. I feel helpless and really sad.

Is there a yoga/retreat center where I can enroll my parents to keep both of them away from alcohol? How are other people dealing with alcoholic parents? Is there a support group?

1iue0mk,"Escapism, A personal story - Emotional Unloading","I don’t know how to start this.
So, I’ll start by saying some characters might have been changed for the sake of story line.
This is not a self pity party. It’s an emotional unloading. Towards my brain constantly telling me I am not good enough. And today I just wanted to send it out as en experiment to see 1. Whether it resonates with enough humans in Nepali culture.
2. What the majority thinks and why do they think so. No sarcasm, no bullshit, no self help recommendations. Pure life truth v/s Nepali cultural life truth. Similar stories will highly be appreciated. 

I am the only son of my parents and I have two elder sisters. I was always treated better than both of them, in education I was in English medium school but both my elder sisters were in government schools. I was treated very differently, I grew up with privileges and pressures, I enjoyed my school years because I was really good at Math. I won some Math contests that I’m super proud of although currently they just feel like long lost their glistening. I haven’t been a good son, at all. I was so selfish that I got out of the country after +2 and just stopped calling them. While growing up I did the least to help anyone in the family. I grew up getting by not doing things because I felt my only worth was my exam score. I worked hard to make my parents proud through my grades. But during my teenage years I got into Arts and once abroad, I got into heavy drugs. 

Most of it was again, escapism from the self imposed pressure of making my parents proud and the guilt I have been carrying for over years. I am severely depressed from time to time. I feel kinda worthless and guilty around my parents or my sister, at any or all the time. 

I don’t even want to ask anyone for advice because I have thought and overthought these so many times I am tired. I just want to vent perhaps. But my story is closer to Nepali culture than to any other that at least I know up to my understanding. I don’t even kind of care if it doesn’t but we use Reddit for a reason …

I have a lot of insecurities when it comes to my Nepali side of things than my abroad lifestyle. It feels so different. It’s like I have shed the old skin and now I’m a NRN, if I’m correct. I have a family with a wife and two children. We are struggling due currently in the job market, well at least I am. I don’t want to burden her with this side of story but she knows, everyone knows that I’m not close to my family and I feel judged by people all the time. My main fear is that if I come back to Nepal, everyone I know, the extended family everyone who knows that I am the only son they have and I have been out of touch with my parents for the last how may years. My wife is highly understanding but I’ll feel so sorry for myself if I bring this out to her. That’s why I chose Reddit. I don’t know what else to say. That’s all for now.

Edit: I try to have video calls with my parents and sisters from time to time.
But the fact that my parents, grandparents and uncles/aunties all live together makes it difficult.
The phone calls go well considering everything but then someone says something to them and I get to hear it in the next conversation.
Societal judgement is something that I don’t see an escape from.

Then again my brain keeps repeating negative thoughts about how I’ve been escaping this stress and my responsibilities for years now.

This post was my therapist’s idea since their western cultural suggestion doesn’t quite align with the eastern culture I grew up in.

1l32sq3,Why Nobody in Nepal Talks About Stoicism And Why You Should Care NOW.,"I know we usually scroll past “philosophy stuff” online, but hear me out.

I recently came across Stoicism, and I genuinely think more Nepalis need to look into it. Not tomorrow. Now.

It’s simple on the surface  you can't control what happens to you, only how you respond.
But once this idea really clicks, it hits you hard.
How much of our daily stress, anger, anxiety, and overthinking is just us reacting without awareness?

Think about it.
Traffic. Family pressure. Unemployment. Friends who ghost.
We spiral. We get bitter. But what if we didn’t have to?

I’ve been testing this mindset in my own life and it’s been... unsettling in a good way.
I’m calmer, more focused, and weirdly okay with not having all the answers.
And I’m not trying to preach I’m just saying most of us are drowning in chaos, and no one ever told us this tool exists.

If you’ve ever felt like you’re tired of reacting to everything, this might actually help.
Even if you don’t believe in it fully, I think it’s something we all should at least try to understand.

So I’m putting this out there:
Have you ever actually tried living like a Stoic?
Do you think this could work in the Nepali context?

Real talk only. No theory. Just share your experience if you’ve tried this, or your doubts if you haven’t.

Trust me  this might be the mindset shift you didn’t know you were missing.

1jstf5e,Need some suggestions or help with being a victim.,"Hey everyone.

I am 16(M) from Pokhara.  Recently my mental health has hit the lowest point. I am a skinny person. Around 40 kg at 5.9"". I am getting bullied hard in school. Everyone plays around and mess with me like a toy. I have a 6 member friend group that talk good when talking individually but are very mean when they find a pair. At first i used to brush it off as jokes but now its getting too repetitive and its starting to form a breaking point . 

Few days ago, I went to a family function (bratabanda). All of our cousins met and i just couldn't keep hating myself. We had partly same genetics and i look like a fucking anatomy lesson on orthopedics. Even my youngers cousins blasted me with various insults. I got bullied by my cousins.

I even tried to bulk and gain weight and join a gym but i just couldnt afford those stuff financially. The cost is too high for my standard. My family doesnt make enough to fund this ""process""i guess. My mothers disease really has given a big blow to us financially.

To escape this i tried to learn electric guitar. But again i just couldn't because the courses cost very high. And even a standard e guitar costs 10-30k which is like a begger trying to buy a mansion for me.

This stuff taking me into a suicidal spiral. Its also affecting my studies. I got 3.70+ gpa in SEE and i dont know how i will do in SLC if i dont find a solution to this shit.

To make some money i tried to look for jobs online but didnt find anything .Physically i cant do shit even if its a shit i can do its not available in the form that it pays me.

So what should i do? I would be very thankful for job opportunities and genuine suggestions.

Simple words of gratitude also mean alot.

1k5ob77,Our Rara trip was less “heaven on Earth” and more “how many ways can people scam us?”,"So we (8 broke but excited students) decided to visit Rara — the lake, the legend, the dream. But what we didn’t know was we were signing up for a live reality show called “Everyone wants to take advantage of you!”

Let’s start from the top.
We met this guy named Ravi Dami at Balaju Buspark while we were there to get tickets. Seemed like a helpful random guy at first, offering to manage tickets to Kohalpur. We were suspicious, but hey, he got us tickets, so we trusted him. He even arranged a vehicle from Kohalpur to Nagma, and we thought, “Maybe this guy’s actually solid.”

Plot twist: he wasn’t.

Day of departure: bus was supposed to leave at 5 PM. We reached at 3. Guess when it left? 7 PM. Classic.
Anyway, we reached Chitwan fine, but due to bad road conditions at Daunne, the bus staff told us we had to reroute via Pokhara and Palpa, but pay 500rs more. After bargaining, we settled on 350. That was just the start.

Then came the car crash saga.
Bus gets hit before even reaching Palpa. Hours to settle it. We start moving again — and BOOM, another car hits the same damn side of the bus again. I’m not even kidding. Bus was guilty this time. More waiting. More headaches.

We finally reach Kohalpur and stay the night. Morning comes, we’re ready by 7 AM. But the vehicle Ravi had booked for us shows up already full. Turns out they assumed we hadn’t reached Kohalpur and gave our seats away. The audacity.

We call Ravi for a refund. He sends some of the money, but not all. We find out he had overcharged us in the first place. We didn’t mind if he had done his job, but he failed. So now we’re mad and stranded.

After 2-3 hours of pure stress, we find a 4-wheeler to take us to Nagma for 30K. We’re like, fine, let’s go.
Midway, at a place called Manma, the driver stops and says “This is it.” We’re like, NOPE. We had someone waiting for us in Nagma, hotel booked and all. But this guy refuses to go further.

Cue the lovely locals. Instead of helping, they insert themselves in the convo, use abusive language, and suggest the driver charge us more. We tell them to back off (respectfully), and finally settle with the driver to pay 3K more. He takes us to Nagma. End of that nightmare, right? Nope.

The next morning, we had booked a jeep to Rara for Rs. 1500 per person. Jeep was supposed to arrive by 7 AM. Guess what showed up at 9? A bus.
And apparently, it would only take us partway unless we paid 40K. After another round of bargaining, we talk him down to 28K. Exhausted but desperate, we go. Finally — finally — we reach Rara.

And let me say: Rara is breathtaking.
We stayed at Rara Durbar Homestay, and the locals were amazing. Probably the only peaceful part of the whole trip.

Next morning, we went to Murma Top (beautiful), came back by 4:30 PM and the bus driver was fuming because he had to cross an army checkpost by 6 PM. Said if he missed it, we had to pay double. We rushed, prayed, calculated timings like it was an exam — and hit the checkpost at 6 sharp. Found out later the actual cutoff was 6:30. We were being played again.

Made it to Jumla, did our project work, then tried returning. Took a bus to Surkhet — supposedly leaving at 8, but actually left around 10. And this bus was cursed. Fan belt broke. Engine kept overheating. We had to stop every 2-3 km. Ended up sleeping at Manma (again).

Next day, we finally reached Surkhet by 4 PM. But surprise — no bus seats available. Every bus was full. Locals were suggesting we sit in the driver’s cabin or on plastic chairs in the aisle for 8+ hours. Like… seriously?

After a lot of hustle, we found a bus to Pokhara — but it had already left, 20 km away. So we took a local bus just to catch up with that bus. Reached Pokhara the next morning. Then finally took an MnS Adventure bus back to KTM. The only good bus of the entire trip.

Final thoughts:
This trip made me lose faith in people. Everyone was trying to make money off us. Help came with hidden charges. Hospitality? Nah. Just price tags. Rara was worth it, but damn, the journey was pure stress. Never seen so many people so ready to exploit travelers.

If you ever plan to visit Rara — be prepared. And maybe bring a lawyer.

1juygi5,To All SEE Students – Don’t Let the “Scope” Scam You!,"Heyyy SEE graduates! First of all — **congratulations on surviving 10 years of Nepali education system** 😂  
You did it! GPA aaune cha, relatives ko call aaune cha, “aba k garne ta?” question aaune cha. So let me help you out before you jump into the next chaos.

#  The CS/AI Boom is Not What You Think

Everyone’s suddenly like “Bro, CS le ta crore ko job dincha!”  
Yes, and I’m Iron Man. 🫡

Look, this CS/AI boom is just like what happened with **Civil Engineering after the 2072 earthquake**. Everyone ran toward it thinking ""scope! scope!"", and now most of them are scrolling LinkedIn all day with “Actively Looking for Opportunities” in bio.

**Same story is repeating in CS.**  
It’s already **overcrowded**. Unless you’re seriously into tech, have been building stuff already, or are super passionate about it — **don’t join just for hype.**  
For every person who lands a “package in crores” that you see on Instagram, there are **999 others ghosting companies after 7 unpaid internships.**



#  “Bridge Courses” and “Skill Classes”? More Like Bridge to Nowhere



Institutes be like: “Join our AI/ML class and become next Elon Musk in 45 days!”  
Meanwhile, they teach you how to make a calculator in Python.

These bridge courses are mostly a **scam to profit off your fear**.  
Except for maybe 2-3 good ones, most will just drain your money and time.

Entrance exam? Don’t stress. Unless you’re targeting colleges like **St. Xavier’s, Prasadi, Trinity**, etc., the entrance exams are **not that hard**.  
And let’s be honest — **half the scholarships are based on connections anyway**, not your GPA or entrance score.

#  

# Don’t Choose a Stream Because “Dai/Bhai/Scope Cha”

Please. For the love of all things logical, **follow your passion**.

I’ve seen folks who were into **finance, biology, even music**, suddenly jump into CS because ""scope cha"".  
What happens next? They burn out, regret it, and end up posting vague LinkedIn posts about “career pivots”.

**Scope changes every 5 years. Your interests don’t.**  
Don't be the person who picked CS because TikTok said it's the future.

# 

If you’re from outside the valley and thinking of moving to KTM for +2, here’s a reality check:

* If you don’t have **strong financial backup**, think twice.
* Most students in +2 are too busy mugging up textbooks to build a ""network"".
* If your hometown college has decent results and teachers who don’t disappear mid-lecture — **you’re good**.

Kathmandu isn’t Hogwarts. Chill.

#  What Should You Actually Do in These 3 Months?

Use this break to:

* Discover what *you* actually enjoy
* Learn a real skill online (or offline!)
* Chill. Relax. Touch grass 
* Spend time with family — they deserve it
* Pick up a hobby, maybe learn to cook? (Your hostel self will thank you later)
* Reflect on what you want from life (no pressure tho)

# 🎉 Final Words

**Congratulations once again, SEE warriors!**  
You’ve completed an important milestone. But don’t rush into the next one just because someone said ""yehi scope cha"".

Whatever you choose, make sure **it’s YOUR choice** — not your uncle’s, not your best friend’s, and definitely not YouTube’s.

1kkdcuc,Should I leave my single mom?,"Hi, I M21 is currently living in US since 2 years. My dad and mom are separated so I take care of my mom and my sister from here. I don't really care about my dad since he has his own family but I feel like I should take responsibility of my mom. But, my mom have certain habits that are really toxic. She is really controlling and wants me to do everything she says without any questions. Many of her actions are really toxic which is creating negative impact on my psychology which is affecting my study. It is not that I never told her about this but now I am sure she is never going to change. Whenever I am aggressive towards her with a valid reason, she uses the same traditional manipulation lines like ""maile hurkaye badaye"", ""aba america pugera janne vais"". I just ask her simple questions regarding money, loans and others but all I get is being gaslighted. It's not that I haven't explained everything calmly and told her how her actions are affecting me but she either says okay and repeat same thing again or she agains does the same ""mai usto raixu, mai naramro"". I am just tired of this. I just feel like walking on eggshells even I'm just asking some genuine questions to plan accordingly. She has also been through a lot of hard times after my dad left which I saw myself but still when it comes to dealing with me, I think there is a lot to improve.

At this point, all I want to do is just give her a house to live, save a significant amount of money in her bank and just leave my home and cut the ties. I feel like at this age of 21, living in USA, I can be a very different person and thrive on my career but these things are pulling me down and giving me stress for nothing. But since my mom is single and my sister will also leave home after marrying, I just don't want to abandon her totally.

If anyone has been through the same please tell me how did you handle this?

1k2oqfv,"Hey guys, I have a situation and I want your honest view on this.","So, couple of months ago I joined a training center as a graphic designer. There was a girl, who's also recently joined the center. First, 2/3 weeks was good but, after that things didn't go well. The main trainer and her relation wasn't good. We're close enough so she share all thing she had been through. She always said that the trainer doesn't treat her well. She was a little immature as well, and always took small things really seriously (I think it's because of her traumatizing past). I never judged her for her behavior. The owner also noticed things between them. And confront her what's going on. She said the things but, it was a little immature and supported the trainer. I didn't said anything I just listened to both. I don't know how but I always ended up in the middle in every group, and get a feeling have to satisfy both. I understood her feeling, and noticed the trainer treatment to her (it wasn't good) but, also agreed to the owner point on this. Sometimes I ignored her I was really stressed because of my work. It's not like she didn't tried to change. As for the trainer he wasn't that bad, like you're coming at 7 Am and work tirelessly with very little time to eat untill 7/8 Pm, everyone will be pissed off even with the small things. But, he's also way to hard, and wasn't the good senior. I thing I would have also get mad if he had treated me like that.

She left the training center couple of days ago, I expected she will leave but, didn't expected this sooner. I texted her, the environment was way to toxic for her, and point out my mistakes which was, 'I should have said the things she been through and stand by her when she needed"", when I heard that I was really really sad for her and 'I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING AT THAT TIME' as a friend that would've change a lot. It wasn't the first time she asked for this. I've realized my mistakes and deeply asked for an apology (I don't know how many time I said sorry to her), but, I don't think anyone would give apology for this.

What's your view on this? I don't have female friends so I have no Idea about girl feelings, is this normal?

1jku169,Seeking Genuine Scalp Consultation in Kathmandu — Need Help Beyond PRP/GFC Treatments Post,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a genuine scalp consultation in Kathmandu to understand the root cause of my scalp issues. I've consulted a couple of places, but it seems like most of them focus mainly on PRP and GFC treatments without properly assessing the actual cause or considering possible deficiencies or medications.

I'm more interested in a consultation that prioritizes diagnosing the real issue — whether it's hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiency, stress factors, or anything else — before jumping to treatments.

Can anyone recommend a dermatologist or a trichologist who genuinely listens, analyzes, and provides a solution based on proper diagnosis? Your experiences and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1i9fe9m,Nepali's Abroad: DON'T buy gifts from Thamel.com for your loved ones. [REVIEW],"* Recently, I purchased gifts worth approximately $300 for a special occasion. These included items such as a cake, flowers, chocolates, sweets, fine wine, alcohols and a ₹10,000 (costing me ₹15,000) gift voucher for a store called *The makeup factor*y. I also paid a significant premium for same-day delivery, ensuring the gifts, ordered early in the morning, arrived by evening.

While all items were delivered on time, the overall experience was disappointing. The packaging was poorly handled—several chocolates were crushed, cake was poorly handled by the delivery driver, and the flowers were damaged on one side. Also, the driver was very rude..

The most upsetting part, however, was the experience with the makeup store, *The Makeup Factory*. After almost 4 days, my recipients went the make up store to redeemed their gift voucher(gift card). The makeup factory store manager and their employees suspected my recipients of attempting fraud and treated them unfairly, akin to criminals. It took 30-40 minutes of back-and-forth argument, phone calls to me and [thamel.com](http://thamel.com) before they were finally allowed to redeem their gift vouchers. This unprofessional behavior tarnished the entire experience, making an otherwise thoughtful gesture stressful for everyone involved.

1jpudx7,Moving My Pocket American Bully from the UK to Nepal - Any Tips?,"Hey everyone,I’m reaching out to the pet lovers and travel pros here because I’m hitting some walls and could use your wisdom! I’ve got a Pocket American Bully (15 inches tall, 35 lbs, basically a muscular cuddle bug) that I need to bring with me from the UK to Nepal. I’m moving there for work soon, and there’s no chance I’m leaving my little dude behind—he’s my shadow.I’ve got the basics sorted: he’s microchipped, up to date on rabies and all shots, and I’m working on the health certificate. Nepal seems to need an import permit from their Department of Livestock Services, which I’m digging into, but the real headache is finding an airline that’ll take him. The UK’s XL Bully ban has me paranoid—my pup’s well under the 20-inch XL height limit, but his Bully build might still raise eyebrows. Worse, a bunch of airlines have breed restrictions that lump “Pit Bull types” or “bull breeds” together, and I’m worried my Pocket Bully falls into that gray area. I’ve checked a few—like British Airways, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines—but their policies either ban “dangerous breeds” outright or require cargo travel, which I’m nervous about for a 35-lb dog who’s never been crated that long.Has anyone flown a Bully (especially a Pocket) from the UK to Nepal or somewhere similar? Which airlines worked for you? Did you go cabin, cargo, or some other route? I’d love to hear how customs handled it too—did you need extra proof he’s not an XL or a banned breed? On the Nepal side, I’m still figuring out that import permit process—any tips on dealing with their authorities? And from the UK, is there anything Bully-specific I need beyond the usual export docs?I just want this trip to be safe and stress-free for my pup—he’s chill as can be but hates being cooped up too long.

I want to stress the importance of the allergy - realistically I probably won't die if I eat nuts except maybe peanuts and more likely Brazil nuts - but I have an epipen and I want to be safe and have read that the understanding of allergies and their dangers are more limited and different to what most people in UK (where i'm from) etc. know.

Can someone help me out with translations that will actually be easily understood by locals please?? Would be a massive help (maybe actually save my life haha). If one thing translates better or more clearly and is similar but gets the same message across please use your knowledge of the language to make a better translation. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH PEOPLE! **Here are the phrases to translate:**

\- I am severely allergic to peanuts and other nuts. // I have a life-threatening allergy to peanuts and other nuts.

\- I **can** eat **almonds** // **Almonds** are **okay** for me to eat

\- I don't want any food that contains these ingredients // Please do not give me any food containing these nuts.

1ki6hvm,Change into bookstore,"Guys, my parents have a floor empty and I am thinking of convincing my mom to change it into a bookstore/cafe. My mom is the only one who lives at home, apart from the tenants, and she was complaining about the previous tenants who left without settling. The rent is 13k (for a hall(fully furnished) with 2 bedrooms, a kitchen and an indoor bathroom).I don't want her too worry about the next tenants, so i want to bring in some bookshelves, fill it up with books and just sit in with a coffee-maker. I know bookstores don't do well, but it is better than stressing over tenants everyday, don't you think?

1k2ssjx,Sathi possessed bhaidira ? Near heaven dada,"We were just supposed to have a good time. Six of us, three bikes, a bit of booze, and a late-night escape to the hills around Heaven Dada—somewhere quiet, open, away from the usual chaos. We didn’t know that night would completely change the way we see one of our own friends.

We reached the hilltop around 8:30 PM. The place was dark, silent—perfectly still, like something was holding its breath. We were trying to start a campfire, but the wind just wouldn’t let it happen. Every time we lit a match, it blew out instantly. I was already uncomfortable, telling the guys, “Starting a fire in this wind? Dumb idea.” But they insisted. And the second the fire finally caught on, the wind stopped. Just like that. Gone. No rustling leaves. No breeze. Nothing. It was like someone flipped a switch. That silence… it didn’t feel right. I felt a chill crawl up my spine. But I shook it off. Maybe I was just overthinking.

After a few drinks and some music, someone said, “Let’s play the silence game.” The rule was simple—everyone stays quiet, and the first one who makes a sound has to walk to a far-off tree, touch it, and come back alone. I lost first, laughed, grabbed a flashlight, and did it. No big deal. The second guy went. But he came running back, visibly shaken. “Something felt wrong,” he mumbled. But he didn’t want to talk about it.

Then it was Harens turn. As a joke, we decided to hide while he walked toward the tree, thinking he’d get scared and come back looking for us. But he didn’t. He just kept walking. When we peeked to check on him, he had gone way past the tree—far beyond where he was supposed to stop. He wasn’t scared. He wasn’t confused. He was walking with purpose, like he needed to go somewhere. Bisnu ran after him, calling his name. When he came back, he looked pale. “He wasn’t going to stop. He didn’t even turn around once.”

Around 10:30 PM, I told everyone, “It’s time to head back.” But Bisnu? He was dead against it. Now let me be clear—Bisnu is usually a sweet, simple guy. Scared of his own shadow sometimes. Never the pushy type. But that night? He turned into someone else. He started emotionally manipulating everyone to stay. Told us how much fun we were having, how magical the place was. When we tried to vote, he ignored it completely and went around persuading people one by one.

The strange part? As time passed, he got weirder. He blinked less. His voice had this weird tone. It felt like he was trying to pull us deeper into the jungle—like he wanted us to be somewhere specific. Somewhere dark. We even moved to a nearby sightseeing spot where you could see the whole city of Kathmandu glowing under the stars. Clear skies. Beautiful view. But Bisnu? He still kept insisting we go back into the woods. His reason? “You can see the stars better from there.” But it was a lie. Someone even showed him a photo we took to prove the sky was clearer where we were. He didn’t care.

At 11:05 PM, my friend Manil —probably the only one other than me who could feel that something was off—said, “Let’s stay until 11:30, then we’ll leave.” The moment he said that? Bishal lit up. Like he was winning. That’s when it hit me—the goal was to keep us there until midnight. Not just for fun. Not because we were enjoying ourselves. Because something, or someone, needed us there until 12 AM. And Bishal… or whatever was inside him… was buying time. He started targeting the weakest one in the group, saying things like, “Come on, let’s go back. It’ll be fun. You’re scared, aren’t you?” I couldn’t take it anymore.

I turned to him and snapped: “What if this place is haunted? What if YOU are possessed?” For the first time all night—he went silent. I tried to laugh it off and said, “What is it, man? You got a demon in you or something?” And then… He made this sound. Not a laugh. Not a scream. Just… something wrong. Something that wasn’t human. I’ve never felt cold like that before. It was like the air itself froze. That’s when I yelled, “We’re leaving. Now.” No one argued. We got on our bikes and got the hell out of there.

As we were riding downhill, we saw a baby calf standing alone by the side of the road. And instantly, the air shifted. The fear, the tension—it was like it got left behind in the forest. Like we had just crossed a boundary and whatever was chasing us… couldn’t follow anymore. We reached our hostel in silence. No one talked about it that night. The next morning, I tried to bring it up. Most of them brushed it off. Laughed like nothing happened. But Manish and I? We knew.

What makes this whole thing worse is… this wasn’t the first time Bisnu had changed. A while ago, he had gone camping back in his village. When he came back, people said he was different. Not drastically—but something about him had shifted. So now the real question is this: Was something already inside Bishal before we even went to the forest? Or did he pick up something that night? Either way… I’m not going near him until I know for sure.

You can believe it or not. But if you were there—if you heard the sound he made—you’d know exactly why I’m telling you this. It wasn’t just a weird night. Something followed us. Or worse… it never left.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1k2ssjx/sathi_possessed_bhaidira_near_heaven_dada/,4/19/2025 9:55,25,0,32,English,1,0,1,0,0,2

I built a simple website that **compiles reported accidents and other critical incidents** from multiple news sources **3 times daily**. The goal? To keep these events visible and accessible to everyone.

The site’s core feature is a straightforward counter showing how many days have passed since the last reported incident in categories like accidents, natural disasters, or public safety issues.

I also added an **Anonymous Chat** to let people discuss these topics openly without fear of judgment. While anonymity can sometimes be misused, I trust that most users will engage respectfully.

1jo7aug,"Struggled with Caste-Based Judgment, Changed My Name – Now Facing Bigger Issues!","
I belong to the so-called Dalit caste in Nepal.

Since childhood, I have had a fear that people would judge me based on my caste because it happened quite a few times. This fear remained until my +2. I used to feel embarrassed whenever my full name was called.

So, with the recommendation from the ward chairperson, I changed my name on my citizenship (Nagrita) from ""Rohan Sarki"" to ""Rohan Nepali."" I knew this wouldn't change everything, but at least my caste wouldn't be directly mentioned. I also ensured that my documents linked both names as belonging to the same person.

Now, in my bachelor's degree, I have registered my name as ""Rohan Nepali"" because I plan to apply for a foreign visa after graduation. However, I recently learned that having different names in my documents could lead to my visa being rejected or cause significant complications.

At this point, I no longer feel embarrassed about my caste. I just want my documents to be clean and consistent, like everyone else's.

What would be the best option for me? Should I change my academic records to match my Nagrita (as Rohan Nepali), or should I change my Nagrita back to Rohan Sarki?

Which option would be less complicated and more feasible?

If anyone has knowledge or experience regarding this, please suggest the best course of action.

Any suggestions would help me a lot,
This has been my serious problem in my life, i don't know what to do.

1j3wlos,Spectators assaulted in the stadium,"Spectators are considered as Gods (just like customer is God or king in businesses) because without them games cannot be sustain but the incident happened in the final match of KP Oli Cup suggests otherwise. Spectators were attacked by political organization's activists if they are meager. Mere amount of people in the stadium raised their voice on the spot against this act. Security personnel around there became bystander and did nothing against the attackers. The news reported that they even handover the spectators to the attackers who in turn get rid of them off the stadium. It was reported that 4k of the total 16k spectators were the organization's men to subdue those who protests against KP Oli. As I have also watched the game, I observed there were many vacant seats in the stadium at the later stage of the game which I am sure now were turned out to be occupied by the Oli's men.

Now referring to the initial sentence, what if no audience came to watch games in the stadium in fear of security risks or protest of the incident. There were also very few spectators during the tournament beside the final, presuming it was an exception as former popular Italian goalkeeper was invited in the final. It will ultimately affect players and stakeholders of the sport. I am in no support of disorder and vandalism but if rulers can't withstand the resentment of the general people then it is no different than autocratic rule our martyrs fought against. Therefore, to save the sports, safety of the spectators must be assured and utmost concern. Nevertheless, I see very few notable people, organizations and stakeholders of the Nepali football speaking against this incident.

1kt05h0,BBM.LLB student in Nepal- am I doomed? Brutally honest confession + salary questions,"Hello everyone 🙏. I’m a BBM.LLB student at Kathmandu University, and I’ve been wanting to know how much a law degree holder could reasonably expect to earn monthly—both as a fresh graduate and after gaining some years of experience.

Before anything else, I want to share my experience studying law for... well, let’s just say a couple of semesters—I’d rather not invite gossip. So here it is: years of pent-up frustration, mostly directed towards myself. To start, I’ve mostly been scoring a B+ (GPA 3.3+ out of 4) by the end of each semester, with minimal involvement in extracurriculars. I mostly find myself wasting time throughout my semesters and end up cramming the entire curriculum just the night before my exams. I resort to this because it’s the only thing I’m remotely good at—and because of this, I can’t even recall what I studied one or two semesters ago, even for subjects in which I scored a 4.0.  

I’ve never thoroughly read any coursebook and mostly depend on PPTs provided by lecturers. To sum up, I don’t have a habit of reading; exam fear is the only thing that drives me to glance at the PPTs the night before exams. I lack motivation to do anything productive, I’m a master procrastinator, and even worse, sometimes I find myself spending 30 minutes memorizing a single paragraph only to retain nothing. Basically, I feel hopeless about myself.  

To top things off, we’ve been told by our professors—and notably by renowned figures in the  Nepalese legal sector who’ve visited our university for talks, seminars and whatnot—that we shouldn’t expect a good salary for the first 5-10 years of practice. Some individuals who started out as private practitioners have even said that there may be months where we might find ourselves netting negative income. So, at the end of the day, I don’t even know whether choosing law was the right decision for me. 

I’m aware there are multiple career paths for law graduates, but as someone interested in litigation (though I’m an odd case to even consider it, given my abilities), I’d like realistic salary insights for this and other career paths for a law graduate. (I can't think of dropping out now, can I? I don't wish to be disowned and left on the streets. T-T)

Sooo..... do you think someone like me could survive as a legal professional? I don't even know why I'm writing this wall of text. Part of me is screaming for validation, while another part is just desperate for motivation. I’d appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or shared experiences: anything that I can latch onto and move forward. 

Thank you and sorry for the rant.

1il8s23,"Rant on American Dream, Politics, and the Immigration Hype","I want to clarify something. I have seen people saying, ""I'd take Democrats any day,"" while criticizing Trump and commenting on the state of America. Having lived in the United States for 25 years, I can say that politics does not significantly impact the daily lives of ordinary people the way it does in Nepal. Here, nobody cares which party you support or who you voted for. Regardless of who is in office, the fundamental rules remain the same—some administrations tighten certain laws, while others loosen them. For example, deportations were at their highest during Obama’s presidency, yet most people were unaware of it.

Regarding Trump’s policies, he targeted illegal immigration—emphasis on illegal. Moreover, these removals were not arbitrary; there were reasons behind them. Imagine a situation where individuals from Bihar enter Nepal illegally, engage in unlawful activities, and transfer money to India without contributing to Nepal’s economy. That would naturally raise concerns.

If someone comes to the United States, works hard, pursues education, and secures a legitimate job, there is nothing to fear. If you put in the effort, this country truly is a land of opportunities. However, if someone engages in activities like operating illegal gambling machines, participating in online gambling, or repeatedly breaking the law like most people do, then they do have reason to be concerned.

Update: It seems like people are assuming I’m some kind of Trump supporter, but that’s not the point I’m making. My aim with this rant is to stop the fearmongering that’s being pushed by many YouTube channels and the media. The constant spreading of fear is doing more harm than the actual policies themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1il8s23/rant_on_american_dream_politics_and_the/,2/9/2025 6:41,0,0,20,English,0,1,0,0,0,0
1l42h54,Suggestion for Bike ride for begginers,"So, I posted couple of days ago about me trying to learn to ride a bike. I was having issues balancing the bike. On day 2, I somehow managed that issue. But now I’m having difficulty keeping the handle straight. It shakes and it’s never stable.

I’m riding the bike only using clutch, no throttle input. And I can manage to hold the bike handle straight for a few seconds and then when the handle tilts slightly to either side I lean my whole body and can’t seem to correct it. Any tips on that? 

And a question. Can we actually keep the bike stable for longer distance just by using clutch and no acceleration whatsoever? I’m asking because I experimented a little bit today and I found it easier, way too easier to balance and handle the bike when I used slight a bit of acceleration. The bike was stable but I didn’t really try to using the handle fearing I might hit a wall or something.

1ji6mmz,Rate my story ( Rakhtasahar: Part1),"# Title: Aren’s Wrath (Rakhtasahar ; Bloodtown) 

# Part 1: The Blood-Stained Path

Aren had been through it all—martial arts champion, elite fighter, and now, a hitman for Tomang, the ruthless druglord of Kathmandu. His gang, led by him, operated in Lalitpur, one of Tomang's key territories. Tomang's empire was vast, extending across drug smuggling, weapons trafficking, and other illicit trades. But underneath it all was a fragile balance of power—each district, each valley controlled by a separate druglord, yet all supposedly aligned under Tomang’s banner.

Aren's crew was tight-knit and efficient, built on loyalty, skill, and a deep sense of brotherhood. His stepbrother, **Kiran**, stood by him through every battle, every bloody encounter. Kiran wasn’t just family; he was Aren’s backbone—calm, wise, and the one person who could bring Aren back from the edge when his rage threatened to consume him.

The gang itself was composed of:

1. **Ravi** – The strategist, always thinking ahead.
2. **Ishaan** – A tech expert, specializing in surveillance and hacking.
3. **Vikram** – A demolitions expert with a flair for explosives.
4. **Arjun** – The sharpshooter, precise and deadly.
5. **Aditya** – The infiltrator, skilled in stealth and subterfuge.
6. **Zayan** – The muscle, capable of breaking bones with his bare hands.
7. **Kabir** – The driver, always ready for a quick getaway.
8. **Karan** – The medic, the team's lifeline in dangerous situations.
9. **Aakash** – The negotiator, skilled in manipulation and bargaining.
10. **Rehan** – The weapons specialist, an expert in arms and tactics.
11. **Meera** – The lone female fighter, fierce and skilled in hand-to-hand combat.

But the beating heart of the gang was Kiran, Aren’s stepbrother and confidant. Together, they formed an unbreakable unit—until betrayal tore it all apart.

A rival gang, under the orders of **Bhagirath**, the druglord of Bhaktapur, ambushed Aren’s team during a covert mission. Bhagirath had been misled by Tomang’s manipulations, believing Aren was planning to take him out to expand his own power. In a brutal assault, eight of Aren's gang members, including Kiran, were killed. The survivors—Aren, Ravi, Ishaan, Vikram, and Meera—barely escaped with their lives.

The betrayal stung deeper than the loss of the men—it was the loss of Kiran, his brother. This was no longer about territory or power; this was personal. Aren swore revenge on Bhagirath, and with it, a vow to tear down Tomang’s empire if necessary.

# Part 2: Revenge in Dhulikhel

Aren's thirst for vengeance became a burning fire. He and the remaining members of his gang set out to dismantle Bhagirath's empire bit by bit, targeting key infrastructure, safehouses, and smuggling routes. The attacks were calculated and deadly—Aren's anger fueling every strike.

Bhagirath, cornered and fearing for his life, retreated to his heavily fortified estate in **Dhulikhel**, thinking he was safe. But Aren was relentless. His team infiltrated the estate, using disguises and stealth tactics, launching a final assault. Aren and Bhagirath faced off in a brutal fight, their blows echoing with years of hatred and bloodshed. In the end, Aren prevailed—Bhagirath was killed, and Aren’s thirst for revenge was momentarily sated.

However, this victory was short-lived. Bhagirath's death created a power vacuum in Bhaktapur, and Tomang wasted no time consolidating control over the valley. But Tomang’s manipulations were far from over. He knew that Aren’s actions could potentially expose the syndicate’s true nature, so he made a ruthless decision: Aren had to be eliminated, and any trace of the gang’s involvement needed to be erased.

# Part 3: The Fallout

Tomang’s cold-blooded decision was carried out by **Hashrat**, a sadistic and brutal enforcer who carried out Tomang’s orders without hesitation. Hashrat, a notorious gang leader under Tomang’s command, was the perfect man for the job. He was a man who relished pain and fear, and his methods were infamous. Hashrat was tasked with eliminating Aren and his remaining gang members, including their families, to avoid any loose ends.

* **Ravi** was captured at a safehouse and tortured for hours. His body was then dumped on a busy street, a public spectacle meant to send a message.
* **Ishaan**, the tech expert, was hunted down while visiting his family. Hashrat had his parents and sister murdered before killing Ishaan with his own hands.
* **Vikram**, the demolitions expert, was blown up in his own hideout in a cruel irony.
* **Meera**, the lone female fighter, was cornered and killed after watching her brother and parents slaughtered by Hashrat’s men.

Hashrat’s brutality was unmatched. Each kill was personal, and each family he destroyed was another step in his mission to ensure no one would question Tomang’s authority.

Aren, knowing his gang was all but wiped out, barely escaped the carnage. His heart heavy with grief and anger, he decided to flee Kathmandu. He had nothing left but vengeance and the ruins of his former life.

# Part 4: Aren’s Retreat

Aren retreated to **Darjeeling**, where Kiran’s widow, **Rita**, and his two children lived. Kiran’s family had been left in the dark about the bloodshed that surrounded them. Aren took it upon himself to protect them, becoming their pillar of strength in the wake of Kiran’s death.

Though Aren tried to lay low, the scars of his past would never heal. His new life in Darjeeling was a quiet one, but the shadows of his former life constantly loomed over him.

# Part 5: The New Threat

The tide of change had already begun to turn. **DIG Aryan Sharma**, a recently transferred Deputy Inspector General from outside the valley, had been tasked with one objective: dismantle Tomang’s criminal syndicate and restore order. Aryan was a principled officer, relentless in his pursuit of justice. His reputation for taking down corrupt networks preceded him, and he quickly became a thorn in Tomang’s side.

Aryan’s investigation into Tomang’s operations led him closer to Aren, but he was unaware of the complexity of the power struggle. Aryan believed in justice, while Tomang believed in total dominance—each would clash, with the fate of the syndicate hanging in the balance.

# Post-Credit: The Hunt Begins

Hashrat, having completed his mission to eradicate Aren’s gang, now set his sights on Aren himself. In a dark, smoke-filled room, Hashrat spoke to his men: “The last loose end. Aren’s still breathing, and that’s a problem. We finish this. No mercy.”

With Tomang’s orders clear, the hunt for Aren would begin anew. As the shadows closed in on Aren’s peaceful existence in Darjeeling, Aryan’s investigation intensified, bringing the city of Kathmandu to the brink of chaos.

1jo63od,"Only constructive feedbacks, please!","Growing up in a middle-class family in Nepal isn’t easy. You work hard, graduate with dreams in your eyes, but reality hits hard—there’s no job waiting for you. You apply everywhere, but no one seems to care about your degree or the countless hours you put into studying. They all want experience—years of it—and your internships just don’t count. You’re stuck, forced to rely on your parents even after all that education. It feels disappointing and helpless.

Desperate to break free from this cycle, you decide to start your own business. But running a business doesn’t come naturally—you’ve never seen anyone in your family do it. Still, your father steps up. He believes that if he supports your dream, maybe you’ll stay in Nepal and build something here. But he’s cautious—always reminding you of risks and constantly wanting to be involved. You feel the pressure from both your own ambitions and his fears. Despite the support, the business doesn’t take off. It fails miserably, leaving you with a sense of defeat and guilt for the money lost.

With no job and a failed business haunting you, you decide to join a masters. You hope that maybe a higher degree will open doors, but even that decision feels shaky. You think about getting a job while studying, but then doubt creeps in—the development sector in Nepal is struggling, and you know it too well. You’ve invested years into this field, but now it feels like it’s slowly dying, and the idea of building a career here seems almost foolish.

You want to gain experience and start a new business someday, but no other industry trusts you. It feels like you’re stuck in a loop—too qualified to start from scratch in a new field, but too inexperienced to move forward in the one you’ve chosen. You wonder if you should’ve taken a different path long ago.

You feel lost, unsure of where to go from here. The weight of expectations and your own dreams keeps pulling you in different directions. You’re just trying to make something out of your life, but every step feels like it’s pulling you deeper into uncertainty.

Is this the common Nepalese problem?

1hvdeim,How Can I Solve Sound Pollution in My Village While Living in Kathmandu?,"

Hi, Reddit community!

I’m currently living in Kathmandu for my studies, but my home village in Madhesh Pradesh has been struggling with severe noise pollution, particularly from temple loudspeakers. While I deeply respect our religious and cultural practices, the excessive use of loudspeakers—sometimes early in the morning or late at night—has become a serious issue for the villagers' peace and well-being.

My Concern:

I want to help reduce the noise pollution and promote a peaceful environment in a way that respects the traditions of the village. Since I’m not physically present, I’m looking for advice on how I can address this problem effectively from the capital city.

What I’ve Thought So Far:

1. Awareness Campaign:

Writing letters to temple committees or influential members of the village, explaining the adverse effects of noise pollution on health and mental well-being.

Creating posters or pamphlets to spread awareness, which I can arrange to distribute locally.



2. Engaging Local Contacts:

Reaching out to family members or friends in the village who can help communicate the issue to temple authorities.

Encouraging them to initiate discussions with community leaders.



3. Legal Approach:

Researching laws or guidelines in Nepal about sound pollution and loudspeaker usage, then sharing this information with local authorities or committees.



4. Alternative Solutions:

Suggesting ways to lower the volume or limit loudspeaker usage to specific times.

Offering alternatives, such as temple bells or manual announcements, during quieter hours.




Challenges:

Being far away makes it harder to engage directly with the community.

Fear of offending people who may see this as a criticism of their traditions.


How Can I Act from Kathmandu?

I’d love advice on how I can actively help from here in Kathmandu. Has anyone successfully tackled a similar issue from a distance? What’s the best way to engage with my community without being physically present?

I’m also looking for resources, legal information, or creative ideas to ensure my efforts are impactful and respectful.

1kfyefn,"Nepali Relatives: Experts in Judging, Useless at Helping","Ah, the joys of motherhood in a Nepali community. Everyone loves to chime in about how hard motherhood is however they do absolutely NOTHING to make your life any easier.

Typical interaction post-birth. Relative gives baby exactly 2 minutes of attention (if lucky), then immediately goes into interrogation mode. 
“So normal ho ki operation?”

Yes, my birth method is apparently public property now. I still don’t know why this is the opener for every conversation. Is there some hidden prize I don’t know about?  Are we handing out medals for vaginal deliveries? Or just a certificate of shame for C-sections? Because no one and I mean NO ONE has asked how my recovery’s been. But sure, let’s rate my uterus like it’s a goddamn restaurant on Yelp.

Next question like clockwork:
“Doodh chha? Breastfeeding ho ki formula?”
 
And before I can even open my sleep-deprived mouth to answer, they launch into a Ted-talk session on how breastfeeding is so good for the baby’s immunity, brain, future Nobel Prize chances and basically world peace. Formula is apparently baby poison. Zero inquiries about whether I have supply issues or mastitis. It’s honestly impressive, the way people are so invested in the type of milk my baby drinks but couldn’t care less about whether I’ve eaten, showered or felt human in the last 72 hours.

Motherhood is so hard, they say. But what they really mean is: it’s hard for you, not for us. We’ll be here to judge, compare and emotionally drain you but actually help? Pfft. Don’t be ridiculous.

1im7hjf,"Day 3. Swayambhunath temple ,getting lost and joined the birthday party.","Preface

Many times in life, there are unexpected and special things that leave a lasting impression on us. These moments are impossible to predict in advance. But it is precisely these moments that bring unique joy to our lives. Today, three things made my day unforgettable: the Monkey Temple, getting lost, and my conversation with Naresh.  

First: The Monkey Temple

As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the architecture itself deserves four stars, but overall, the scenery of the Monkey Temple is truly mesmerizing. A few monkeys sat quietly on the eaves of the temple, seemingly gazing over the Kathmandu Valley. In the distance, the city buildings were scattered across the landscape, shrouded in a soft mist, creating a hazy beauty. The layers of mountains in the background blended into the sky, giving an ethereal and distant feeling.  

At that moment, the golden glow of the setting sun bathed the monkeys and the temple roof, outlining a warm, golden silhouette. I felt a profound sense of peace and sacredness, as if the entire world had come to a standstill just for me.  

Yes, this was my first time reaching the top of the Monkey Temple. And as I gazed over all of Kathmandu, I felt a sense of relaxation and freedom that I had never experienced before. So, I decided to simply sit there and do nothing—just wait for the sunset. Listening to Nepali songs, I let my mind go blank, staring into the distance. I waited—for someone, for a breeze, for the setting sun.  

At that moment, I truly understood the leisurely pace of life in Kathmandu.  

Second: Getting Lost

Because I stayed at the Monkey Temple for too long, I drained my phone battery while listening to music. Just when I confidently thought I had brought my power bank, I suddenly realized—I hadn’t! At that moment, it hit me: I was still at the Monkey Temple, and today was my friend’s father’s birthday. I had promised to be home by 7 PM. But I was 5 kilometers away, and by the time I finished watching the sunset, it was already 6 PM.  

Taking a taxi? Well, I only had 140 NPR left. But this was my friend’s father’s birthday, and no matter what, I had to be on time. Initially, I was confident in my sense of direction. However, when I reached a fork in the ring road, I started feeling uncertain. So, I asked a police officer for directions and followed his advice. But after walking for half an hour without seeing anything familiar, I realized I had gone the wrong way.  

No problem! I decided to head toward Thamel. This time, I asked locals for directions. However, unlike other capital cities, Kathmandu has no street signs. In northern China, roads are mostly straight, but Kathmandu’s streets are intricate, with one alley leading into another. Even with a map, it's difficult to navigate. But for some reason, I was still overly confident in my sense of direction. So, I walked for another half an hour, yet there was still no sign of my way back.  

At that moment, I finally realized—I was completely lost. Suddenly, it dawned on me: I can recognize streets in China because I grew up there. But Nepal is a foreign place where I don’t understand the language or writing. My usual experience and navigation skills were completely useless here.  

I didn’t want to admit defeat—I enjoy challenges. But I had to acknowledge that finding my way in a foreign city, without a map, relying solely on asking for directions, was simply too difficult. So, in the end, I asked a shopkeeper for help and politely requested to charge my phone. Fortunately, the kind shopkeeper agreed. However, as he handed me my phone, he accidentally broke a glass cup.  

At that moment, I felt guilty—I barely had any cash left, and I had forgotten my power bank. Otherwise, I would have just taken a motorbike taxi home or just walk home. But after calling my friend, he immediately arranged for someone to pick me up. On the phone, I cried and apologized, saying I got lost and was delaying his father’s birthday party
 I also told him that I didn’t have enough money left and asked if he could lend me some. He simply replied, “It’s okay, just come back. We’re all waiting for you. As long as you’re safe, that’s what matters.”  

By the time I got home, it was already 7:30 PM. But there was no blame, no complaints. Instead, the first thing my friend said when he saw me was, “Are you okay? Do you want something to eat?”  

To be honest, growing up in a single-parent family, my mother was always busy with work, and I rarely felt her care. I also had no siblings. Was this what it felt like to have an older brother? At that moment, all my emotions poured out—the frustration, the guilt—all melted away.  

His younger sister saw this and tried to comfort me, saying, “It’s okay, I get lost too. Last time, I didn’t get home until 8 PM.” I knew she was lying, but I still felt comforted. I secretly wiped away my tears and joined everyone in celebrating the birthday party.  

The party itself was quite traditional—making wishes, blowing out candles, cutting the cake. Then came the familiar singing and dancing—endless dancing. Everyone surrounded the speaker, joyfully dancing as if there were no tomorrow. I forgot everything and just danced around his father. His sister jokingly said, “Look, your pants are about to fall off!”  

Everyone burst into laughter.  

Third: The Mitru Ceremony

After eating the cake, my friend introduced me to a special ceremony called Mitru. A Hindu fortune teller and priest were invited to perform the ritual. We exchanged gifts, which we were supposed to keep for a lifetime. From that moment on, we were bound as lifelong brothers.  

Curious, I searched for Mitru on ChatGPT. Wow! I was surprised to learn how sacred this ritual was. Apparently, most people only have two Mitru brothers in their lifetime. But we had only known each other for three days! Feeling the weight of this commitment, I opened up to him about my family, my career, and my life.  

Later, I found out that his father had five Mitru brothers in his lifetime. At that moment, I felt relieved. So, ChatGPT was wrong, huh? Haha!  

I don’t like making promises lightly, nor do I want to make promises I can’t keep. Three days may be short, but for the right person, one glance is enough. I trust my instincts, and I don’t regret accepting his request.  

Final Thoughts

Sometimes, we need to trust ourselves. But other times, we shouldn't. How do we find the right balance? That depends on our wisdom.  

I'm so exhausted. It's already 11 PM. Time to sleep early.

1kekbha,"Ride Review, Rubi Valley from Rasuwa","TLDR: Kathmandu, Nuwakot, Syafrubesi, Gatlang, Somdang, Pangsang Pass, Tpling, Sertung, Borang, Jharlang, Darkha, Katunje, Nuwakot, Kathmandu\~300 km\~11 hrs total riding time completed over two days. First Night stay at Somdang and second night back home to Kathmandu. One of the challenging offroad rides, especially the uphill part  from Somdang to Pangsang Pass, and the Downhill part on newly constructed parts while descending from Tipling and Sertung



So we decided to go on an impromptu ride to Rubi Valley last weekend on my new Xpulse 200 4V. It was May Day Holiday and we departed home at around 7 30 in the morning. We took the tokha route to Nuwakot, then went towards betrawati where the pitch roads ended. We then took the trishuli corridor to Syafrubesi, saving us a lot of time bypassing kalikasthan and dhunche, but the offroad part started about 10 kms from Betrawati. We reached Syafrubesi at around 11 and had masubhat lunch there.

The road from Syafru to Gatlang is decent for a adventure bike but still we managed to have a low speed crash over some loose gravel breaking the tips of my crash guard which did its job by saving the radiator. We pickup ourself up and headed towards the Chilime dam site on the way to Gatlang. The current view of Gatlang has deteriorated as it is not a ""black village"" as it is famously know as the reconstruction after the earthquake has meant brick and mortar buildings with colorful tin roof. Anyways, we headed towards parbati kunda and took a small break there. It would have been better if the alpine wetland was left on its own without any gaudy concrete embellishment but I digress..

The road leads towars a burnt forest which looks alien to the max, very eerie feeling as we stopped for some reflection and photos in the middle of the destruction. You can find the link towards how this happened and some insight on ecological succession [here](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2025/05/1674159/a-glimmer-of-light-within-the-black-hole?fbclid=IwY2xjawKC8T9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHm894LemLfGYldsFqInQceViZkNyZ2Sf-r_1I7q1FmmgR39VUgyiVx7yU115_aem_1T_03ISm93jimT9uM_PMUQ).  The uphill part from here to Somdang was tough but my bike's performance was satisfactory and could easily do a pillion climb. However the pass was very foggy and we did not have a view of the cliff face below so we could not really tell how precarious the road was for the better.

We stayed the night in Somdang at the Somdang Valley Guest house which was a testament to the remoteness of the place. The guest house was operated by a mother and her daughter in law and their newborn Habil Ghale. We were told that guests were few and far between in that place which was quite different from other rides near kathmandu valley which are getting ever more popular in recent times. There was no electricity in the place and no network coverage, neither Nepal Telecom nor Ncell. We bought a chicken for 2500 in the village and shared the evening meal with the family. The normal cost for food was 350 for veg dal bhat and 400 for the room.

In the morning the skies cleared around Somdang and we could see the peaks near Paldor from our balcony. I added three teaspoon full of instant coffee to my tea in the morning, had some granola bars and readied for the tough climb ahead. We had been warned by a vlog about the terrible road conditions and it was a test for the motorcycle. As you know, as further away from civilization you go, roads turn to tracks and it is mostly a matter of bricolage than engineering in road construction leading to over the code grades and sharp hairpin bends. On top of that the road was very rocky and broken which tested the motorcycle to its limit.. and it kind of gave up as well as the balancer gear seems broken after that leading to some vibrations at low rpms.

Anyways, after about a little more than an hour we reached pangsang pass which was worth the treacherous climb up. Although we only got a fleeting glimplse of the Ganesh Himal massif the cloudplay in the pass was beyond words. We immersed ouself into the atmosphere by hiking up a ridge which we reckoned must have added at least a 150 m altitutude to the 3850 m altitude of Pangsang pass making our climb to 4000m landmark. There was one teahouse in the pass which was closed (we knew about this closure as we were advised at somdang). You can catch Nepal telecom reception at Pangsang which gave us an opportunity to call home as we were off grid last night.

We descended from Pangsang to Tipling through a dense rhododendron forest where you can find red, white, pink and purple rhododendron. The downhill part is fun and technical from here to Tipling, you can find solitary shelter huts for shepherds and stone paved downhill tracks whih will test your vehicle's suspension and gears, and your spinal compression. After about an hour downhill from Pangsang pass near Tipling we finally met another person. We stopped there and talked to him about five minuted just with the sheer joy of seeing another person after Somdang.

We stopped in Tipling for lunch and some rest. After the meal we watched the Augusta Westland helicopter of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak land in Tipling to inagurate a Armed Police Force Border Outpost there. But the irony of the fact is that with all the gold smuggling going on from Rasuwa, we just made a detour from Rasuwa towards Dhading and the security presence was nonexistant in this part of the Northern Border. Maybe it is a testament to the toughness of the route we took, in retrosepct.

The road down from Tipling to Sertung was treacherous as the grade was sheer and it was akin to ploughing a rocky field with the handlebars as your plough and the engine with its bovine potential at first gear. The structure of the road is such that you have to start at the higher ward numbers of Rubi Valley Rural municipality and traverse each ward, with a river in between and the hairpin bends connecting them. Anyways, we traversed through Sertung which also had its newly constructed road to challenge us in the downhill portion.

After Sertung, the roads do get better after Jharlang following the Aankhu Khola towards Darkha and Lapang. From Lapang, we headed towards katunje to meet the Pushpalal highway which is ready forr its final layer of asphalt giving us a comfortable ride at careful speeds to avoid the deposited aggregate for several kilometers, after which the highway was completed most of Dhading District. However, the highway abruptly ends at the border of Nuwakot giving us some more opportunity to ride on offroad track.

We met blacktopped roads again near Trishuli, and headed back through Tokha. Reached home at about 730 in the evening.

1.  **Joy Montessori** : This one seemed really fun, their classrooms were nicely decorated. They had students artwork and worksheets up on the walls. The staff also looked experienced.  
2. **Kohinoor Montessori**: This one is probably the most known one in Lubhu, its one of the oldest and most established ones. They have experienced teachers and decent facility. I have heard many good this from many parents about this school, but they seem to have a issue dealing with overcrowded classes.  
3. **Api Montessori** : They had nice open spaces, the outdoor area looked nice. Classrooms were also nice, and the students seemed very engaged in their activities. The teachers were very friendly as well.
4. **Ankuram Bal Batika** : This one stood out, maybe cause its new. It has very modern facilities, also it has open sunny classrooms. They also had a big variety of meal options. For their curriculum, they are associated with Joy Bells School, meaning they will use a well tested curriculum.

Ankuram would also be the closest option to where I live, but I’m a bit hesitant since it’s a new school and doesn’t have as much history as the others.

1klgc11,How can I help my Nepali boyfriend feel better while he’s homesick in the US?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice on how to support my boyfriend, who is originally from Nepal and currently living in the U.S. without his family. While he has a good Nepali community here and close friends he can lean on, I can tell he’s been feeling really homesick lately.

I’m American and while I don’t fully understand everything he might be going through, I love him deeply and want to support him in a way that’s meaningful and culturally respectful. I’ve noticed that certain holidays, food, or even music can trigger both joy and sadness for him. I’ve tried asking him directly how I can help, but I think he doesn’t want to burden me or make it a big deal.

For anyone who has been in a similar situation—or if you’re Nepali yourself—what are some small or meaningful things I could do to help him feel more at home or connected to his roots while he’s here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nepali/comments/1klgc11/how_can_i_help_my_nepali_boyfriend_feel_better/,5/13/2025 7:56,2,0,5,English,0,0,1,1,1,1
1jatmxo,Happy Holi and Happy Fagu Purnima,"Today, children laugh together, their faces painted with vibrant colors, as they run through the streets, blissfully unaware of the invisible lines society has drawn between them. In this fleeting moment, they are innocent souls, united in the celebration of Holi's joy and togetherness. But as they grow, the world around them will whisper divisions into their ears—media will fill their minds with stories of separation, politicians will use their unity for votes, and society will remind them of their differences. Gradually, the bright hues of childhood will fade, replaced by the dull shades of prejudice and mistrust. What was once a festival of love will slowly become a distant memory of what could have been.

1l226fl,Is this some kind of maturity or am I losing out on my childhood wishes and happiness?,"Just saw a post on another sub where a guy didn’t eat for 4 days so his dad could buy him an iPhone on an 8800 EMI. Made me realize that I’ve never really asked my parents for anything big. Got scholarships since childhood by grinding my ass out, but never demanded stuff in return.

My only big ask was an electric guitar, which I got a year later after saving them a year of fees during class 9 and 10. Always loved gaming, tech, and PCs but man I played PUBG/FF on a Galaxy J4. Always watch review of tech, pc and AAA games but stuck with Minecraft at 40 fps on a 7-year-old laptop that only runs plugged in and was gifted by my uncle. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't have one till now.

Man I never wanted to be a financial burden. One police officer's income runs our whole family, covers my and my sister’s education, house loan, etc.

I am out here learning programming, other skills, trying freelance at the age of 16 to make some money and grinding my ass all night since childhood just so I can save them some rupees through scholarship.

Meanwhile, I see people my age spending thousands on shoes, dates, and vapes.  
Of course even I want to enjoy teen life too. Go watch movies, go on dates, wear expensive clothes, play AAA games and enjoy but just not at the cost of my family.

I can't have expensive clothes, gaming PC or such stuff. Not when my mom is using the same old phone whose battery is dead asf and my father works day and night. Not when they choose public buses over pathoo to save bit of money. Not when they sacrifice their own wishes to complete ours.

This is not a rant and I am thankful to my parents and couldn't ask more from them. **BUT** is this some kind of financial maturity that I somehow developed since childhood, or am I just missing out on my teenage life and might regret it later?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1l226fl/is_this_some_kind_of_maturity_or_am_i_losing_out/,6/3/2025 3:46,54,0,34,English,0,0,1,0,1,0

1l33p0e,"Requesting Help Planning Budget Nepal Trip (July 22–31) – Transport, Local Tips, Any Contacts?","Hi r/Kathmandu community,

I’m planning a budget-friendly group trip to Nepal from July 22 to July 31 and would really appreciate your help! We're a small group (all in our 20s–30s) and excited to experience Nepal's nature, food, and moderate adventure – especially local, authentic stuff and not just touristy sightseeing.

Here’s our rough itinerary:

22 July: Arrive in Kathmandu

23 July: Sunrise trip to Nagarkot + visit Bhaktapur, return to KTM

24 July: Bus to Pokhara

25 July: Pokhara (Peace Pagoda, boating, maybe paragliding)

26 July: Travel to Ghandruk (via Kimche), stay overnight

27 July: From Ghandruk to Chitwan (via Pokhara/Nayapul)

28 July: Safari + Tharu culture in Chitwan

29 July: Back to Kathmandu

30 July: Kathmandu Valley tour (Boudha, Patan, Pashupati etc.)

31 July: Depart


What I need help with:

1. Transport Advice:

Best places to book reliable, budget cabs for Nagarkot, Ghandruk, Chitwan, etc.

Approx costs for tourist buses and cabs on routes like KTM–Pokhara, Pokhara–Kimche, Chitwan–KTM.

Any local platforms/apps you recommend?



2. Monsoon Tips:

How bad is monsoon in these regions in late July? Any route closures we should know about?



3. Local Recommendations:

Best places for authentic food on a budget – especially momos, Newari dishes, and thakali thali.

Hidden gems or lesser-known spots you’d personally recommend?



4. If You Have Any Contacts (big or small):

Someone who runs a homestay, is a driver, a trekking guide, even someone who knows how to get good deals – literally anyone helpful anywhere would mean a lot to us. We are friendly folks and would be happy to support local businesses and individuals instead of just relying on big companies.




We’re really looking forward to exploring your beautiful country. If you have advice, numbers, links, or just encouragement — please drop a comment or DM. 🙏

Thank you so much!
Dhanyabaad! 💙

1jniqmk,I dont know what to make of this,"Do you know pilgrims book house? Thamel ko. So me and my friend were happy to go there looking for a book. But the moment I walked through the entrance, the security gate (you know the one when you pass through goes beep beep) beeped. So the lady at the front desk asked me to pass the bag in separately and told me to walk after. I wasnt even there 5 seconds but her tone was already accusatory. I didnt like it but aile ke ke bhairako cha so I chalked it up to security reasons and did as she told. Turns out whatever in my bag was causing the beep. Then she told me that I cant take my bag with me and to give it to her. And I did. Then we went looking for the book. Wasnt there, so we were making our way through the exit. By that time, lady was in the back and an uncle was at the front desk.

Again, she shouted from the back to take the bag separately, walk out separately. It felt completely rude and confusing. I went out, stood there a couple minutes contemplating whether I should go in again and clear the air.

I went in and asked the uncle calmly why they made me do that, twice and that I was just trying to understand the situation. He just kept saying he didnt understand, it wasnt about me and that I shouldnt take it to heart. How can that not be about me when they specifically made me do it? No one else. Everyone else was carrying their goddamed bags inside the store. So while uncle and me were having that discussion, the lady came back and asked what was wrong. So I confronted her. And she said it was to make sure I hadnt taken anything without paying. And okay that makes sense, and I told her that and I walked out.

Now heres the catch, if that was the case, why did she make me do that the first time I walked in? What, did I put something in my bag during the 5 seconds I stood in the door? It felt wrong and weird the first time and by the end it felt downright discriminatory.

I loved going there. It has books other stores normally wouldnt keep. But now it just feels disappointing. Am I overthinking this? Or are my thoughts valid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kathmandu/comments/1jniqmk/i_dont_know_what_to_make_of_this/,3/30/2025 18:17,3,0,3,English,1,1,1,0,0,2

2. What makes a cup of coffee “perfect” for you? (e.g., bold flavor, smoothness, ethical sourcing, convenience, etc.)
3. What’s a fair price for a 250gm bag of high-quality coffee? (Be honest-no judgment!)
4. What’s missing in current coffee brands? (e.g., sustainable packaging, unique flavors, subscription options, instant coffee option,  etc.)
5. Which coffee origin, within Nepalese border do you prefer? (e.g., Kavre, Lamjung, Gulmi, taplejung, etc.)

**For Non-Coffee Drinkers:**

1. What would make you try coffee? (e.g., less bitterness, caffeine-free options, health perks, dessert-like flavors, etc.)
2. would you like to find your taste? like in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iNAyu-ejo&t=1s), where Tom Scott tries coffee with James Hoffmann

1jio540,Can't find who I really am,"20(M) Basically I'm studying CSIT in TU and I had a 1 year gap while applying for a US visa. I'm really into Music and Arts. I write poetry, Music and I have an obsession towards arts even tho I'm really interested in tech as well

But at this point I don't know what I wanna do anymore I feel kind of lost as I'm average at everything. I m trying to do better at everything I enjoy but it feels that I wanna do so much it drains me the fuck out and I will always be an average guy at everything 
I have developed so many personalities that I don't know what I'm anymore. Some nights I feel empty as I started to try different learn different shit to know where I belong and even after so long all I feel is me lossing parts of me 

Initially I was an introvert but now I have alot of friends. I molded myself by going into stage and doing speeches and many more things now I have good social skills but...at the end when it's time to share something I feel I'm back being a scared little boy to socialize.

1j2l626,How a 10-Day Vipassana Course Deepened My Connection to Buddhism,"I recently attended a 10-day Vipassana Meditation seminar at Dhammashringa Vipassana Meditation Center at Budhanilkantha, Kathmandu. I completely finished the course in its entirety and didn't escape in the middle of the course like some do. There were some difficulties at some points of the course as is for everyone as this is a very difficult thing to do, 10 days without talking or communicating to anyone, no phones and meditating, I overcame the difficulties with the eagerness to learn the technique and to really experience what it is like to be liberated. I had a great experience and I felt it was life-changing.

Though Vipassana meditation is non-sectarian or non-religious and anyone can attend the course to practice it, it was taught by Siddhartha Gautam, the Buddha. As I am from a Newar Buddhist family from Kathmandu, I observed many Buddhists, traditions, rituals and festivals, went to various Buddhist temples/monasteries, but I didn't understand the core values of Buddhism, and it felt like it was more of a tradition than a spiritual practice. I would enjoy the mystique and serene vibe brought by the artworks, sculptures and architecture but had always yearned to know or experience what it was all about.

Through Vipassana I actually learned what Buddhism is truly about. I don't condemn other sects of Buddhism or practices as they have their own way of conveying the same message but in different ways, but I felt like Vipassana was one of the purest and truthful way of experiencing what Buddhism is all about. I am eager to learn more about other forms of meditation and Buddhism as well and got a new-found respect for Buddha and Buddhism. I would recommend any interested people to attend the course if they can spare 12 days.

1l3squn,Planning my trip to Nepal during Mid September,"Hey everyone,

I’m taking a month off from work in September and I’m planning a 2-week trip to Nepal. This will be my first international trip, and I’m both nervous and super excited.

This is what I was thinking:

The first few days – something slow, relaxing, and cozy. Nice places to visit, enjoy the culture, and just settle in.

For the next days – I really want a scenic and adventurous trek. I’m athletic and active, so I’m okay with moderate difficulty treks (not extreme) – something memorable, scenic, and safe for a first-timer.

I have a budget of 1,00,000 INR per person. Is that realistic for a 2-week romantic + trekking trip in Nepal?

Also, is it better to go with a travel agent or should I plan the trip independently? I’m kinda scared about this.

What treks would you recommend for first-timers? Something scenic, moderately challenging, and safe?

Any other places to visit other than Kathmandu or Pokhara?

I’m looking for a mix of love, fun, culture, and adventure – mostly focused on exploring and experiencing the outdoors.

Any ideas, help, suggestions would be really helpful!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1l3squn/planning_my_trip_to_nepal_during_mid_september/,6/5/2025 7:02,8,0,5,English,0,0,0,1,0,1

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering (3rd year), and I’ve been thinking a lot about building valuable skills alongside my core studies.

* Strengthen my resume
* Open up more job/freelance opportunities
* Possibly switch or blend into other domains in the future

I’m already exploring include SolidWorks . I’m also curious about fields like coding, data analysis, cybersecurity, and freelancing .

So my question to you all is:

**What are the most useful or high-demand skills to learn while doing a Mechanical Engineering degree?**

However, I’m a bit unsure about the career opportunities for data engineering in Nepal. I know the field is growing globally, but I haven’t seen many openings for internships or jobs here specifically focused on data engineering — at least from what I’ve come across online.

I’m planning to go abroad in the future, but before that, I’m looking for a local internship to fulfill my college graduation requirement and gain some real-world experience.
So, I wanted to ask:

Is data engineering a viable career path in Nepal right now?

Are there any internship opportunities or companies here that hire entry-level data engineers or related roles (like data analysts or backend devs with data focus)?

What skills should I focus on more if I want to land an internship locally before going abroad?

1kqyuq3,NepalSocial Discord Server – My Final Statement (repost here because they banned me),"To the 131 people I personally invited to NepalSocial: I owe you an apology.

I truly believed the server had changed — that its leadership, especially bkes, had distanced itself from the enabling of disgusting behavior, including the tolerance of pedophilia disguised as “jokes” or “personas.” I was wrong. And I regret inviting any of you into a space that was, and still is, fundamentally unsafe.

Let me be direct: **NepalSocial has protected predators and attackers.**  
From the cases of Humble Lettuce, Narapungawa, Freakymindx, jra, and gg, it’s become clear that bkes would rather shield long-time members — his so-called “OGs” — than protect victims or uphold even basic human decency. Jra threatened to beat rocky up and you sat back and watch, not even interfering.

People were doxxed. Publicly humiliated. Harassed for speaking out. And where was bkes? Hiding behind his mod privileges and Reddit anonymity, enjoying the chaos while pretending he was powerless to stop it. He let it all happen — and at times, encouraged it.

This isn’t just negligence. It’s **complicity**.

Let’s not forget — this is the same man, a 30-year-old jobless ""uncle,"" who flirted with a 19-year-old under the excuse of being “just a Discord persona.” The same man who defends jokes about grooming and “waiting for minors to turn 18” as if they’re some kind of edgy humor. He claims this is what makes the server “lively.” No, bkes — it makes the server a haven for predators and degenerates.

I used to look up to you. Now, I see you for who you really are:  
A coward. A manipulator. And a man so allergic to accountability that he creates new servers, bans critics, and rewrites history anytime someone gets close to the truth.

And if you’re reading this, I know what you’re thinking: you’ll just delete this post. Maybe even ban my account. You’ve done it before. You’ll do it again.

But understand this:  
You can delete posts, but not the truth.  
You can ban me, but not silence me.  
You can run, but your reputation will catch up with you.

NepalSocial has become a cesspool of incels, predator apologists, and people who think exploiting minors is a joke. And the worst part? Its leadership — you, bkes — actively contributes to that culture.

You’ve officially earned the title of the weakest, most cowardly ""leader"" I’ve ever encountered in online spaces. The day you stop running from accountability is the day you’ll start becoming a man.

Until then, enjoy your little kingdom. Just know it’s built on filth, denial, and the suffering of those you failed to protect.

1jjr2vy,Has Nepal become a land devoid of hope?,"Long time lurker here. Was wondering what the end game could be in Nepal. Obviously the current state of affairs cannot continue forever. Could it end in an actual civil war? Total breakdown of law and order? Eventual annexation? 

(Long read warning)

Even nature has a threshold for evil/bulls$hit beyond which it the evil cannot continue. I get a feeling we are reaching that stage in Nepal. 

What has been going on in Nepal for the last 30 years is nothing short of crime against a people. It cannot continue forever even by natural laws. Something has to give. 

The simple thing is that the current governing dispensation doesn’t give the slightest damn about the consequences to any of their actions and holds the people in absolute contempt. Zero industrialization, no infrastructure upgradation, a stagnant economy for close to 30 years(!), crisis after crisis, rampant misgovernance, mass outmigration, broken families, (soon to come) old people dying alone without their kids around in their last moments, people compelled to leave their familiar surroundings, families for the unknown of alien foreign lands, uprootedness, a dying society with no genuine means of making a living in the country, overall suffering and utter hopelessness. Taken in totality all they have done in the last 30 years and the amount of human suffering they have caused is a crime against humanity. Some people will differ, but that is what I feel. 

Obviously not all of the 30 million people can migrate out of the country. That is a mathematical impossibility. Many will have to stay back in Nepal and suffer. 

Most of the young, energetic people who could pose challenges to their grip on power and question their loot and abuse of the country are outside of Nepal providing them extortion money in the form of remittances to give to their cronies as salaries, perks etc in this bloated three-tiered government structure and bureaucracy. The remaining young people in the country are political serfs who will act and do as they demand (jholey) because their livelihood depends on their masters (netas) as there are no private sector jobs. The rest are old, infirm, women, children who pose no challenge to their death grip on the country. So they are very emboldened to do whatever the fcuk  they want to do. 

The mafiazation of all the institutions of the country has been gradual and now complete. A government will only act ethically if it is forever AFRAID of the people. This setup is such that, there is really no credible opposition inside the country, with the three parties partaking in serial “gongbong” of the country (apologies for the crude analogy, but I can’t think of anything more apt). The three parties are actually just one big party, whose only and sole principal and single minded focus is to make ill gotten gains through abuse of power, NOT communism/capitalism/social democracy/social justice/economic growth/industrialization etc. The “nanga naach”we see has few peers in the world among nations today. Maybe Syria, Sudan but definitely not among any nation during peacetime. 

This setup also suits the foreign powers like India, US, EU. They prefer a weak, diffuse state, so that their “activities” can continue without an effective bar from a strong central Nepali state. India wants Nepal as a semi chaotic state over a prolonged period to have it collapse onto it over the long term. India is playing the loooong game. If some other dispensation comes to power in Nepal, then that entity will certainly not be “officially” recognized by the global powers robbing it of any international legitimacy. 

Nepali people are basically orphans without any guardians or friends. The foreign powers are not our friends as they don’t want a prosperous, peaceful Nepal. Loook at the extent to which they can go by what happened in Ukraine. A country destroyed, millions of young men, killed, maimed, forever traumatized. So many orphans!  No remorse, no reckoning, nothing. For them their interest supersedes our well being x1000. The global order as it stands is ruthless and simply antithetical to our happiness,well-being, prosperity. And ordinary Nepali people have no guardians, protectors working for their well-being. Think about the poor lady that sells vegetables or poleko makai on the street side. Who is looking out for her? Certainly not the Nepali government! 

And the Nepali govt and the current setup is also not a guardian figure like in other countries. Even in India, the govt seems to be making every effort to care for the well being of its citizenry.They said eff you to the combined might of EU+US and still bought Russian oil so as not to hurt their own consumers. They made Covid vaccines when the West refused to supply them  theirs. Instead the Nepali state is like a parasitic infection on the back of the Nepali people that refuses to heal, slowly sucking the life force out of us. 

I am a Democrat too but unfortunately there is no reforming THIS system. The takeover of the state by these mafia like entities has been complete and is backed by foreign powers. Something radical needs to happen to change the status quo. It is stupid to expect the mafia to reform and suddenly one day become enlightened and turn moral. It will simply never happen. IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE SNAKE TO BITE. 

The question now is at what point will people hold these mafias masquerading as political outfits to account? And can it even be done through the current setup because every single institution is infiltrated- courts, bureaucracy, civil service, the police services, you name it- by the 3-mafia. 

Maybe when the ordinary people have no reason or means to live anymore and their lives become so hopeless and desperate that they would rather die then live, will Nepalis stand up and say- enough! Let’s us see what that breaking point is and when it will be reached. Until that point is arrived at, the screws will continue to tighten. So get ready to bear more and more pain in the coming days, months, years….

Sorry if my post sounds overtly negative, but I wanted to ask- what could be the end game here? What does the cliff towards which we are collectively hurtling towards look like? What will the explosion/crash when it comes (and come it will, just a matter of time) take the form of? Ruwanda/Burundi style killings? Yugoslavia style disintegration? Ukraine style semi-annexation? Or simply, Yemen style failed state?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1jjr2vy/has_nepal_become_a_land_devoid_of_hope/,3/25/2025 18:53,38,0,32,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1j2y8bs,Nepal is poor so read theory,"Whenever I fly from Kathmandu to Berlin, I am greeted with the qualities of a first world country. My train ride is warm even in winter, the train has free WiFi and my ticket is subsidised by the government. 

Germany is the third richest nation on this planet so why is Germany at the forefront of technology and progress while Nepal still remains so poor? 

Many people often jump to ridiculous conclusions trying to understand this imbalance. They may say ""corrupt politicians"" ""Nepali people are lazy"" or the most stupid of all ""bring back the monarchy"". What all these points have in common is that they ignore the biggest reason: imperialism, history and conquest. 

Germany had colonies in Africa and China, exploited labour and resources in countries like Namibia and used it to industrialise. During the rule of the Nazis, Germany expanded their territory, used slave labour from Jewish people and concentrated everything onto war efforts. 

In short: all this progress was made possible by blood, exploitation and the disregard of human life. The German armies also committed a genocide in Namibia but never officially apologised against the victims. 

The USA has similar stories: the USA would regularly use black slaves, colonise other countries like Cuba, bomb other countries for access to foreign labour and resources like Vietnam, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan and so on.

So we have to understand the position of our country amidst these dynamics. Where is Nepal in all of this brutal bloodshed? 
Nepal is a victim of neo colonialism. We took out IMF loans, which conditions us to open up our countries to western companies seeking to exploit our labour and resources for basically nothing in return. Most of our hydro power plants are run by Indian companies, we import more than we export.

Our country is literally designed to impoverish itself to enrich the west and other countries that exploit us. And the more impoverished we get, the more IMF loans we need, the more we allow foreign extraction of our labour and resources, the more we ""open"" our country to foreign powers trying to make a quick buck. Unfortunately unlike Iraq, Cuba and other such nations who are also victims of imperialism and neo colonialism, we bowed down to the colonial overlords, not understanding the dynamics of the power structure in the world. It's time, we notice this and actually put our own industries at the forefront instead of this humiliation we have faced.

1kwsquc,Would you consider marriage without children?,"Hi, I’m a 27yo  woman from Nepal. Like everyone else my age , I’m now under a lot of pressure from my family and relatives to get married. I am not against marriage itself, like being with someone, loving someone or being loved it feels good to imagine idk im not sure but one thing im sure of is I do not want to have children.

This is not something I say lightly ,its a decision rooted in my fundamental values and personal philosophy. It’s not just a career driven or temporary choice and its something I have reflected on a lot  over the years, and I know for certain that this is not something I will change my mind about.

But the problem is ,  I come from a very traditional and conservative family. I know that if I bring this up, it won’t be accepted or even understood. That’s why I can’t openly discuss this before marriage with my family. Even if I try to talk about this with friends, they laugh it off saying this is what everyone says before getting married.

Now since, arrange marriage is the only option for me it seems, I  feel that going into an arranged marriage without being honest about this would be unfair to the person I marry.

I spoke about this with my cousins, and they told me that no Nepali man would agree to a child-free marriage, and that I would basically have to choose between staying single or lying about my stance. And I don’t know what do I do in this situation.

So just wanted to ask, especially to the Nepali men here ,  would you be open to marrying someone who doesn't want kids? Is that something completely unacceptable or unthinkable? I’m not here to debate or argue, I just want to understand how men around my age would feel about this hoping maybe this would help me plan my life I guess.

1kzrenc,I never thought I would post smth like this in reddit. Help me.,"I'll be 18 soon, entering adulthood with my family's economic instability, high expectations, and my own dreams. I come from a lower-middle-class family, and growing up like this hasn't been easy.

Since I began understanding things, I’ve never seen my family free from money problems. That doesn’t mean my parents didn’t try. My dad worked 8 years in the Gulf, but the money he sent to Nepal was spent by his parents (my grandparents). While working there, he developed an ear issue and became completely deaf—doctors say there’s no treatment. After that, my parents kept trying. They ran a school canteen, which closed due to school issues. They made bricks and blocks, but there was barely any profit. Poultry farming didn’t work either. They entered construction work, but dad had an accident and now has a leg that doesn't function well. He now works at a restaurant, cleaning dishes and the place, while my mom still works in construction.

From all this, they saved some money in a cooperative—but it flewed away along with our only wealth—20 lakhs. It was our only hope. Since then, my mom has been on antidepressants.
 Still, they never had to worry about their kids. My sister and I were always happy with what we had. She studied ANM due to money issues, though she wanted to do more. She tried working in Nepal but failed. Now she’s in Japan, studying and working 7–8 hours daily to cover her living expenses, college fees, and repay the loans taken to send her abroad—entirely on her own.

I'm in my final year of high school. I’ve let go of many wishes but never complained. I know life demands compromise. I wanted to study A-Levels but couldn’t afford even the cheapest option, so I let it go despite passing the entrance. I passed the Sainik School entrance too but didn’t join—it was expensive. My parents offered to manage the fees, but I didn’t want to burden them and stepped back. I tried contacting NGOs/INGOs for help, but got no response. Luckily, I got a KMC scholarship and now study in a good school in Kathmandu.

Now my concern is what to do after +2. Scholarships like KMC's are rare, and hard to get for average students like me. I don’t want to study in Nepal without any income throughout my undergraduate years. Studying abroad means taking loans. I’m tired.

If you’ve read this far, I need help. I’m good at studies, communication, public speaking, and event management. I’m not asking for money—just a platform where I can use my skills and get paid. I can tutor school students, train others in speaking and communication, and I’m good in literature too. I’m ready to work in whatever suits me.

I don’t want my mom and dad to leave early on an old cycle and come home exhausted. I don’t want them to grow old without happiness. I don’t want to cry every day thinking about it.

He was probably new to skating just like me.
Guy was struggling with the blue helping rods while we crossed paths.
Bro tried to help me for a second or something but I changed paths for some reason.
Then I saw him 2 to 3 times again while skating but had nothing in mind.
His hour was over and I saw him sitting (still not sure if it was him but I do have this hunch that was him).
I'm not sure why I wanna know him more. I'm fine with or without it.

1ixf3mi,Visiting Kathmandu 7-11 March,"
Hello everybody.

I (M 43) have been granted the opportunity to visit Nepal for a work trip, and when I am in Nepal (and the temperature is +20 degrees) I decided to take a couple of vacation days.

I have read much online and take my time to read one of many travel books, but those are mostly ""SEE THIS"" things. Is there a couple of things you suggested that I visit to get the real Nepal/Kathmandu feeling?

1. As far as I have understood, the criminality is low so I shouldn’t be afraid walking alone in the city, but do people do that or do people use taxi?
(Is there a taxi app or is Uber a thing in Kathmandu?) (is their any other apps I should know about..bus, tram etc?)

2. Mount Everest.. I know that there are planes going around but can you fly an helicopter to base camp one?
Or is their any companies that offer helicopter rides around in the Himalayas? Any recommendations?

3. Language. I have learned some line of Nepali like ""Namaste"" and ""Dan yavada"", but do most people speak English, or should I bring my google translate?

4. Cell coverage. Thinking about picking up an eSIM at the airport, is the cell coverage in Kathmandu ok? (I don’t except much..just google maps and translate..and maybe the taxi app 😅).


Thanks for reading and hope on some cool experiences!!

You might think of it as asserting dominance over the street you *think* you ""own,"" but if you look closely, your **rev bombing** isn’t much different from the street dogs near **masu pasal** barking and acting like the real gangsters of the locality—your guardian being the **masu pasalko dai**  who funds your fuel and delusions.

Hmm, but yeah, I get it. I understand you. You’re doing all this to compensate for that deep, nagging feeling of not being important. You don’t have another way to feel significant. You lack skills, achievements, or confidence. But dude, this is no way to deal with it. All you’re doing is broadcasting your insecurities loud and clear, dear kiddo.

Maybe, just maybe, instead of trying to make noise, you could try making something of yourself. Try adding something valuable instead—something that actually makes people notice you for the right reasons.

1l0mwrp,"I need some help guys pls , attention","Hey everyone… I’m going through a really hard time right now.

I recently left home because I was mentally exhausted and overwhelmed. I sold my laptop, bought a ticket, and came to Pokhara with no real plan—just a hope to find some peace and start fresh. Right now, I have around Rs. 20,000 left and no place to stay.

I’m not here to ask for sympathy—just a little support. I’m willing to work and earn my way out of this. If anyone knows of any kind of job—in a café, hostel, shop, anything—I’d be truly grateful. I’m physically fit, emotionally steady for now, and ready to give 100% to whatever opportunity comes my way.

If you know someone or somewhere that could use an extra pair of hands, please comment below. I’ll reach out.

Sometimes life pushes us to restart. I’m just trying to make sure I restart in the right direction.

1l36ppi,Avoid Tech Inn Laptop Store Pokhara at ALL costs!!!,"This is hands down the most unprofessional, dishonest, and frustrating experience I’ve ever had with any store. We, as customers, understand that sometimes repairs take time, and issues happen but OVER 30 DAYS to fix a single laptop issue? Seriously? That’s absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. We rely on our laptops for work, studies, and daily life and they clearly don’t care.

They kept feeding us excuses like “the part is coming from another country” over and over again. False hope. Lies. Delays. No accountability. And the worst part? I gave them ONE issue, and suddenly they ""found"" other problems. Sounds like a scam. My laptop is less than a year old and it’s already breaking down, this clearly shows they are selling refurbished or extremely low-quality laptops while claiming they are new. This is NOT just bad service, this is borderline fraud.

WARNING TO EVERYONE: DO NOT BUY OR REPAIR ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE. They will waste your time, your money, and your patience. I’m never recommending this place to anyone not even by accident.

Any advice ?

I read the reviews of that restaurant from google reviews. Only 3.5. Reviews of poor service, poor quality seafood boiled. He was probably heavily influenced by that tiktok reel/ promotion video.

1j93gjn,Anti Islam hate is on the rise,"""Sayau thunga ful ka hami eutai mala Nepali""

This is our national song. It emphasises our differences in culture, ethnicity but still pays importance that the Nepali nationality is inclusive and encompassing. This is the nationality that I strike this country to continue. We can't ever and we should never undermine/discriminate/privilege anyone based on these groupings. 

Ever since Modi came to power in India, it has been disastrous. We have a full on Hindu nationalist movement, who exclaim that India can only be a country made for Hindus, while treating minority Muslims as enemy of the state. This creates twnsions between the mostly Hindu backed government and creates clear lines on the sand on basis of religion and identity and therefore starts a cycle of violence between Muslim rebel groups and government backed police/military. 

This sort of hatred is emphasized in the autonomous and occupied regions like Kashmir and I am definetly concerned for Nepal as these ideology of Hindu nationalism will definetly creep it's way towards Nepal and undermine the very fabric of our country. 

Islam is like any other religion. People who practice it will react to material changes around them. If anti Muslim rhetorics get taken up and also find themselves in government laws, Muslims will obviously protest and react militantly against them. This always results to ethnic tensions, racism, phobia and violence that is very difficult to stop. 

I beg everyone to consider these things and not to take the path that Europe or India has taken. An inclusive nationalism can be the only solution to ever lasting peace.

Pretty standard, right? But the comments section? It was full of outrage from vegetarians, calling it ""gross"" and ""inhuman."" Some Indian commenters even went as far as to say things like, ""Ye log asur hain, asur ke kaam kar rahe hain,"" and started bringing up religious references from the Bhagavad Gita, criticizing people who eat meat.

Now, I get that people have their own dietary choices and I respect that. As a vegetarian myself, I don't think hating on meat-eaters is the way to go. It's one thing to choose not to consume meat, but I don't think it's necessary to shame others for their food choices.

What do you all think? Does anyone else feel the same way? Sometimes, it's not just vegetarians hating on meat-eaters, but the other way around too. Let’s be respectful about people's choices.

Most of the songs that get attention target to a certain audience with a certain attention span across short form platforms. Most of the songs that go viral are bad beyond description, lacking any lyrical or production value. The so called lok dohori songs, teej songs and typical Nepali folk songs are mostly the same stuff over and over again, new stuff and experimental music is not given any credit at all.  
Songs like Timi nacha na, Dushman hereko herai, Daryam daryam, and Hyatterika saili are exactly what music should not be.

It burns me to stay in the same house as him and act like nothing has happened and I just don't like him. Because of that everyone thinks, I am generally an unpleasant person and I also get jealous when he tries to spend time with my sisters (age 16 and 14) and my little brother (age 2). Since I was a child I protected my sisters from him and didn't allow him to do anything like that to them even when he said it's either them or me whenever I would say no.  

I am telling this all to you because today my little sister told me that she would even marry an ugly and old man if his character was like our dad. I said I'd rather die than do that, and she was like why, and I couldn't explain anything to her. She sits in our fathers lap and I pull her away and tell her not to but she says he is our father he can show us affection. I think I failed to protect them because a fathers hand lingering in your thighs and his eyes on your boobs is not normal. She doesn't notice it but I do. I have never wanted to not exist anymore more than right now. Our country Nepal's law and society is so fucked up, that I'd rather die than go to trial and be at the mercy of the court and society.

I have no one to tell and no one to trust so, I am telling you this because I do not have it in me to take my sister's innocence and pure love for her father away.

1j2k4vr,Nepal’s Monarchists Want a King to Save Them from the Horror of Too Many Rights,"  
Bring Back the Crown! We’re Tired of This “Freedom” Nonsense  
  
Nepal’s monarchists are back, whining like kids who lost their kite at Dashain, begging for a king to save them from democracy’s wild mess. Too many rights, too many loudmouths—it’s all too much! They want Gyanendra Shah to stumble out of hiding, slap on his crown, and smack away our freedoms so we can go back to the good old days: no opposition, no newspapers, just a king banning shit left and right. Genius move—why fix Nepal’s 2025 madness when you can just outlaw complaining about it? Crown him up, boys, what’s the worst that could happen?  
  
Nepal’s monarchy was never about helping us—it was about keeping us on a leash. The Ranas (1846–1951), those greasy-haired goons, turned Nepal into their own little tyrant playground. Education? Nope—can’t have us reading. Free speech? Nope—shut up or rot in jail. Rights? Ask, and you’d be tied up faster than a goat at a butcher’s. By ’51, only 5% of us could read—perfect, because who needs a revolution when you can’t even write “help”? Then the Shah kings rolled in, giggling, “Let’s ban more!” Mahendra killed parties in ’60, Gyanendra axed democracy in ’05 like he was swatting a fly. These guys banned stuff so hard, they’d have outlawed sunshine if it didn’t kiss their royal asses first.  
  
Gyanendra Shah didn’t even audition for king—he tripped into it after the 2001 royal family massacre turned into a horror show. By 2005, he was done with democracy’s chatter, so he went full dictator mode: dissolved parliament (who needs those clowns?), locked up leaders (too noisy), banned the press (truth’s messy). What’d we get? 1,400 in jail, newspapers gone, and streets full of folks chucking bricks, yelling, “Gyaney chor desh chhod” By ’06, we didn’t just kick him out—in ’08, we burned the whole monarchy down like a bad ex’s love letters. Now, with MPs throwing punches and veggie prices hitting the roof in 2025, some nutjobs want this guy back? Please, you royal bootlickers are dumber than a bag of hammers.  
  
If Nepal resurrects this monarchy crap, what’s Gyanendra banning next? He’s nailed the hits: education (brains breed trouble), free speech (words hurt), elections (kings don’t grovel). In 2025, he’d probably ban WhatsApp leaks of MPs slugging it out, or tax us for breathing Kathmandu’s smog-soup air. Picture it: “Royal Decree: No whining about Melamchi’s ghost pipes—lap up the mud, peasants!” Nepal’s youth are fleeing to Dubai faster than rats off a sinking raft—give ’em a king, and he’ll ban passports, claiming “loyalty’s hotter than remittance cash.” Our laws? Scribbled in royal drool while potholes mock us and jobs vanish. Sign me up—said no sane bastard ever.  
  
  
Here come the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP)—Nepal’s weepy monarchy cheer squad. They’re awful at elections—7 out of 165 seats in ’22, losing worse than a drunk guy betting on buffalo races. With Nepal stuck in 2025’s circus—politicians slugging it out on live TV, prices turning rice into a luxury—they’ve decided democracy’s too tricky. Their big idea? Cry for a king to hand them the win. These losers are so pathetic, they’d crown a stray dog if it barked “Hindu kingdom.” Sorry, boys, Nepal’s too busy dodging coalition flops to care about your royal hard-on.  
  
Kings used to think education was poison—5% literacy meant we were too dumb to riot. Now, monarchists moan that democracy’s a headache: parliament’s a fistfight, tomatoes cost more than your rent, and half the country’s youth are slinging coffee in Dubai. We kicked kings out twice, fought for this hot mess, and won it fair and square. The RPP wants us crawling back because thinking’s hard? That’s not just stupid—it’s a slap to every Nepali who’s ever dodged a falling bridge. They’d ban the news tomorrow if it meant a king, while we’re stuck haggling for onions. Get real, you crown-loving saps.  
  
Monarchy’s dead, and no RPP tears or sappy nostalgia will bring it back. Nepal’s 2025 is a grind—MPs swinging fists, jobs vanishing, air so thick you’d think Kathmandu’s roasting itself—but a king’s as useful as a fart in a fan factory. To the monarchists, royalists, and RPP daydreamers: slap on your big fat L crown and waddle off. We’re done with your sad little fantasy—go cry into your royal fanfic while we dodge traffic and pray for cheaper chiya. Kings don’t fix shit; they just sit on it and stink.

1kh2qiy,Two Nuclear-Armed Neighbors at Odds: How Nepal Could Be Caught in the Crossfire,"With rising tensions between India and Pakistan—both nuclear powers—Nepal may be facing more than just a geopolitical headache. India recently carried out an airstrike targeting Pakistan-based terrorists, and Pakistan has responded with threats of retaliation. The risk of this escalating into full-scale war is growing by the day, and as a neighbor to both, Nepal can’t sit back and pretend it won’t be affected.

This isn’t just speculation. We've already felt the ripple effects of global conflicts before. In the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack in Kashmir (April 22), a Nepali citizen, 27-year-old Sudip Neupane, lost his life while visiting with his family.

Go further back to October 2023, when a Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 10 Nepali students. One more—Bipin Joshi—is still held hostage. These students were part of a ""Learn and Earn"" program from Far Western University and had nothing to do with politics. Yet they became victims of a war thousands of miles from home. Israel's retaliation has since claimed over 52,000 Palestinian lives in Gaza, and the conflict shows no signs of slowing.

And let’s not forget the Russia–Ukraine war. Since it began in February 2022, at least 43 Nepali nationals—many lured into joining the Russian army through illegal channels—have died. Around 1,000 Nepalis are believed to have been recruited, though the Nepalese government lacks concrete numbers. Seven of them are confirmed to be held as prisoners of war by Ukraine.

Besides the human cost, these wars have also wrecked global food supply chains and economies—hitting developing countries like Nepal the hardest.

So while it might seem like a distant political drama between India and Pakistan, any potential war between them will drag Nepal into the chaos—economically, socially, and tragically, very likely with more Nepali lives lost in the crossfire.

We may not be the ones pulling the trigger, but history shows we often pay the price.

1j3ymk1,My Little Sister Is Getting Bullied – How Do I Handle This?,"My little sister (she's in school, I'm 14 years older than her) has been dealing with a mean girl in her class. It’s not physical bullying, but more of that ""bitchy, mean girl"" behavior. They’re in different sections but the same class, and they share the same friend circle. The problem is, this one girl has decided my sister is her target.

The bullying started because my sister was apparently talking to the mean girl’s crush (a classmate). She’s not physically hurting her, but she’s making school miserable with name-calling, nasty looks, and just generally being mean. She tries to isolate my sister from their mutual friends, discouraging them from interacting with her.  
  
My sister has a good group of supportive friends, and they’ve told her they don’t like the bully either. But my sister is still the only one being harassed, and it’s been bothering her enough that she’s been making excuses to stay home from school.  
  
Our dad passed away over a year ago, so it’s just me and my mom looking after her. I was never bullied in school, so I have no firsthand experience with this. I don’t want to overstep, but I also don’t want my sister to suffer in silence.

I've told her that what she says does not matter, and you should focus on improving herself, but obviously that's not a good enough advice for a child.. 

The bigger brother in me thinks she should throw punches to make her stop, but that's obviously no good.. I also considered getting in touch with older students and give the bully similar treatment, but i know that's not good either. I'm worried that contacting the school about this issue and getting the parents involved would just end up humiliating my sister or causing her more social problems... 

I'm seriously at lost what to do? I know my sister will encounter lots of assholes in her life, should I wait a bit and see how she will handle this situation? Or Should i intervene immediately?

1kejbez,am I even being realistic ?,"*are iPhones really worth it? or is it just me overthinking?*

Hi guys, let me be a bit personal here.

I am an IT undergrad in Nepal, and I love seeing tech creators share what they build/know on social media *(few examples include swikar codes, sid ghimire)*

I had thought of doing something similar way before.

It’s not that I didn’t try - I tried, I researched way more, and I found iPhones or other flagship phones seem compulsory to get an initial push.

I see lots of creators with good content or valuable information being shadowed by influencers with high-quality camera phones.

Every time we open social media platforms, we scroll past almost all videos with good cameras, and we tend to **skip** low-camera-quality videos even when the info is gold.

So, every time I think of starting this journey, I hold back, since I’m stuck with a five-year-old phone I bought for about NPR 18,000.

That phone’s camera was poor from the start, and now its mic and speaker barely work.

This is killing my inner desire to start something new in this community.

I thought about talking to my dad, but he and my mom also carry phones around NPR 22,000, so I couldn’t even initiate the conversation.

I genuinely want to represent Nepal in the tech community, since I don’t see many Nepalese tech creators.

For months I’ve been checking Facebook Marketplace and local stores for a second hand iPhone and other flagship phone deal, but it still feels like a dream.

Sometimes I tell myself I might only get a phone through a giveaway - anything, even an iPhone below Series 10; to capture decent quality media, nothing more.

I know this may not connect with everyone, but maybe someone out there has a phone lying unused, forgotten in a drawer, once valuable but now just idle.

And maybe reading this reminds them that even an unused thing can become someone else’s starting point.

If you’ve read till here, thank you so much for listening to an ambiverted guy who writes more than he speaks, and who’s just trying to find a way to start something meaningful in this tech community.

p.s. I just opened this reddit account, since I felt reddit is where I’ll be truly heard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kathmandu/comments/1kejbez/am_i_even_being_realistic/,5/4/2025 13:03,5,0,9,English,1,0,1,0,1,2

1kuxuex,Rohingya people deserve better,"So Rohingya people fled the genocide in Myanmar and settled in Nepal since the peaceful nature of Nepal attracted them. They face little discrimination here and find work since Nepal is already a rather diverse nation, Nepali people aren't the type to have a superiority complex like some other nationalities... Our neighbours to the south. 

But inspite of this, since they are undocumented and Nepal doesn't have any legal refugee status, this means that they are informally here and only get very horrible wages at construction companies. This is honestly not that great since Nepal as a stable country could definelty provide them a refugee status and also have them earn minimum wage like everyone else in the country and also provide a citizenship application process. 

We're one of the poorest countries in south Asia and even the world but even then, many internationally organisations consider us progressive and open minded. So if we're incapable of developing our economy and keeping our country afloat, let's at least win at the progressive department and idk... Provide refugees the legal protection they deserve.

1jn5148,"Football Is Dying in Nepal, and No One Cares","As a lifelong sports fan, I’ve loved watching Nepal’s cricket scene thrive over the past five years. There was a time when even big international matches struggled to attract crowds, but today, cricket has commercialized well, domestic tournaments are structured, and players are getting the recognition and sponsorships they deserve.

Football, on the other hand, is a different story; it's dying, if not already dead. Poor management, internal politics, lack of infrastructure, and our abysmal rankings have made it irrelevant. I can't even name our national team’s starting eleven anymore. A decade ago, I used to analyze the squads of clubs like MMC, Three Stars, and Police with passion. There were real fans, rivalries, and a sense of pride in domestic tournaments. Now? Nothing.

Hats off to Nepal Super League (NSL) for trying to involve private investment and commercialize the sport. But let's be honest—it's not working. Did you see the crowd at yesterday’s opening match? Almost empty stands. Even the YouTube views were embarrassingly low. The problem? People don’t feel connected to these teams. The franchises lack identity, and I doubt the organizers are making profits unless match-fixing is secretly keeping things afloat.

So, what’s the solution? Nepalis still love football; a local ward-level tournament attracts more spectators than NSL. The issue is the structure. We need home-and-away matches to build real engagement. But are we ready for that? Do we have the infrastructure? Can the management handle nationwide logistics? It’s risky, but I think it’s time we try.

ANFA should prioritize upgrading stadiums in all seven provinces, not just Dasarath Stadium. If I were in charge, I’d give an ultimatum: build 6–7 proper stadiums outside Kathmandu in the next two years, not just for NSL, but for the entire football ecosystem. Let mofasal clubs thrive, encourage local businesses to invest, and ensure players earn enough to stay in Nepal rather than working abroad in unrelated jobs. And please, revive and sustain the A-Division League so historic clubs like MMC, NRT, RCT, and Three Stars don’t fade into obscurity.

What do you think? Can Nepali football be saved, or is it too late?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1jn5148/football_is_dying_in_nepal_and_no_one_cares/,3/30/2025 4:46,88,0,30,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

My neighbor is in a tough situation and could really use some advice. My neighbor is in Stage 5 kidney failure (CKD-V). He's on hemodialysis and needs a kidney transplant.

I came to know that buying or selling organs unless the person is related with blood is illegal, so we can't look outside the family.

My neighbor is 41, and his health is deteriorating rapidly. We're trying to raise funds for his medical expenses, but the biggest hurdle is finding a donor. I'm looking for any advice or suggestions on this. He has two children and it is really difficult to see this condition.

1ju5z91,The sad and tragic case of Maina Sunuwar.,"For those who don’t know, Maina Sunuwar was a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Kharelthok, Kavre District, when she was caught up in the chaos of Nepal’s civil war (1996–2006). This was peak conflict time—Royal Nepal Army vs. Maoists, civilians stuck in the crossfire. Maina’s story starts with her mom, Devi Sunuwar, who witnessed something horrific: the rape and murder of her niece, Reena Rasaili, by RNA soldiers on February 12, 2004. Devi didn’t stay quiet—she spoke out to the media and human rights folks, which pissed off the army big time.What Happened to Maina
Five days later, on February 17, 2004, around 6 AM, a group of RNA soldiers rolled up to the Sunuwar house in plainclothes. They were after Devi, but she wasn’t home. So, they grabbed Maina and her younger brother instead. The brother was let go later, but Maina? She vanished. The family freaked out, obviously, and started asking around—local barracks, government offices, anywhere they could think of. The army straight-up denied having her.Here’s where it gets brutal. Turns out, the RNA took Maina to the Birendra Peace Operations Training Centre in Panchkhal. According to later investigations, they tortured her that same day. They blindfolded her, submerged her in water repeatedly (basically waterboarding), and hooked her up to electric shocks. She didn’t survive it—died within hours of being taken. Then, to cover it up, they buried her body in an unmarked grave right there at the barracks. Imagine that: a 15-year-old kid, tortured to death, and her family left in the dark.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ju5z91/the_sad_and_tragic_case_of_maina_sunuwar/,4/8/2025 5:15,179,0,14,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1j6gq57,"What went wrong with Nepali politics in last 15 years, and how do we correct this- my opinion.","This might go on to be a long post, bear with me and give your opinion,

Been seeing a lot of monarchy or republic system debates and discussion in past few days.   
 Which system is best for Nepal? Does democracy really work ? Should we go back to monarchy? If we look at data, Nepal was in bad place back when there was monarchy and after democracy we haven't moved as fast as we should have either. Personally I don't believe in a system where someone gets to lead the country just because they were born to a particular family. Democracy gives us options, and we can actually defeat the established parties, like RSP did in many constituencies in Kathmandu and some outside valley too, like Balen did, Harka sampang did and other outsiders did in last elections. But one vital thing in democracy is it only gets better if these elected politicians are held accountable and are questioned constantly. This is what went wrong after we abolished monarchy and went republic.  People started taking sides, and we took the sides permanently. We became intolerant to critics against the party we supported. We never questioned our politicians, we never tried to hold them accountable, we made them feel like god, they started feeling invincible. Now with Balen, Harka or RSP, similar stuff is happening. If anyone criticizes Balen , you get tagged as ""jholey""; we don't engage in constructive debates nor we tolerate constructive criticisms. We're doing same mistake we have been doing (or lets say our older generation have been doing), we're making these new generation of leaders feel invincible.  I support of the new wave of politicians that got elected and hope they will really be able to clean the dirty mess in political system in Nepal. That doesn't mean I'll never question Balen or Dr. Swarnim Wagle or Sumana Shrestha. Balen recently has been glorified like god, he's not being questioned by anyone, he's not facing media or even public, hides behind cell phone, and the main thing, the capital expenditure of Kathmandu Metropolitcan City is really in bad shape since he's taken over. Who's going to hold him accountable ? Have we forgotten what he had in election manifesto? I clearly remember management of public transportation and traffic was one of his top agenda, and he had even said ""kathmandu along with other cities need to collaborate on this, and if elected this will be my one of the top agenda"". Recently, Lalitpur's mayor said ""balen is not open to any discussions with other mayors of kathmandu valley regarding management of public transit"". Meanwhile Mayor Balen is just chilling out because no one's questioning him. 

Us youth should be questioning him and other leaders and hold them accountable. If they make any promise that's just not feasible, its our duty to question them about its feasibility. Questioning them and holding them accountable will only make them a better leader, else these new waves of leaders are going to end up like KP Oli, Deuba and Prachande. Everyone of us has internet , we have social media platforms where we can raise our voice. Those who think critically need to be organized and once united, we become stronger. I've noticed that most of these politicians use X (formerly twitter). Lets get organized, and start asking questions to the politicians we like, lets stop them from ending up like KP Oli, Deuba or other corrupt fucks. Lets start having meaningful discussions (can be done in this subreddits Discord group) and lets start raising voices. I'm not saying we should be online 24/7 and creating fuss in twitter. Lets have discussions and act rationally. 

I made this post because I've been seeing a lot of political posts, and have been going through comments and some comments are really good, critical and I think if we start commenting where we can be seen , we can really make a difference and honestly, reddit isn't the social media for Nepal, yet.

  
TLDR - we stopped making politicians accountable, took permanent sides and never questioned them. Lets not do same with new wave of politicians . if we like a new politician and want them to succeed its our job to hold them accountable since they were voted by us. Lets not repeat the mistakes our fathers generation did.

So I'm pretty new to Nepali politics overall, I left Nepal when I was pretty young and lived abroad for the last could of decades.
In this time I've studied, worked and grown as a person mostly in a non Nepali political sphere but I'm very curious to our situation back home now more than ever. 
In the past few years I've become more engaged with politics and such within the western nations and their relations to other cultures, countries, etc.

I can speak Nepali but trying to understand politics in nepali tends to be currently out of my scope (it is what it is but I'm trying to engage with our bhasa more so I'm able to engage with the politics here now).

Obviously Reddit forum is probably not the best place to learn all of this but I figure it's a good place to get a feel for what people are feeling, thinking, etc.

I'm a pretty big lurker and rarely ever post anything so this will be interesting for me.

List of parties: [https://election.gov.np/admin/public//storage/Political%20Party/parties.pdf](https://election.gov.np/admin/public//storage/Political%20Party/parties.pdf)

According to [https://hr.parliament.gov.np/en/parliamentary-parties](https://hr.parliament.gov.np/en/parliamentary-parties), there are 14 political parties and 2 independents in parliament. 

1. In your opinion, are any of these existing parties worth supporting in the next election? If yes, why?
2. Does anybody know if a resource exists that tracks the voting record of members of parliament? I found a livestream link but no records. [https://hr.parliament.gov.np/en/parliamentLive](https://hr.parliament.gov.np/en/parliamentLive)

Unrelated but if anybody is curious, these are the requirements to have a party:

""According to the existing laws, no party is recognized as a political party without registering in the Election Commission. Parties can be registered for two purposes: a) for organizational development and b) for contesting in elections. So far 178 political parties have been registered in the Commission.

1k6ub3i,Harka Sampang: The Leader Nepal Needs — But Few Are Willing to Celebrate,"Harka Sampang stands out as *the most genuine and effective leader* Nepal has seen in recent times.

While most politicians love to make big promises and deliver little, Harka flips that script, he under-promises and over-delivers. His actions speak far louder than his words. Just real work, real impact.

From solving water shortages in Dharan to directly confronting corruption, he’s shown rare courage, discipline, and grassroots commitment. He lives simply, works tirelessly, and stays grounded with the very people he serves. In a political system full of self-interest, his integrity feels almost revolutionary.

And yet, *despite his track record*, Harka doesn’t get the support or recognition he clearly deserves. Let’s be honest: one major reason is ethnic bias. He’s from the Rai community, and unfortunately, Nepal’s political and media landscape still favors those from Bahun and Chettri castes. Had he been from Bahun, Chhetri, or another high-caste Aryan background, the media and public might have celebrated him far more, just as we’ve seen in the case of Rabi Lamichhane.

Worse, Harka is often unfairly scrutinized for things that should be praised. Take his *Shram Daan* (voluntary labor) — a symbol of leadership through action. Instead of appreciating his hands-on approach, people mock him: *“Why is a mayor picking up stones?”* But that’s exactly what sets him apart, a leader who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty to bring real change. And the time he won a global award and raised millions for Dharan’s development  the media and public remained silent.

This is the double standard. And it reveals a lot about the caste-based and media-driven

Harka Sampang is living proof of what real, people-first leadership can look like. He challenges the status quo and exposes just how little mainstream politicians have delivered. If Nepal had 10 more leaders like him, we’d be looking at a completely different country in 10 years.

**Please support him. Spread the word. Share his story. Talk about him. Celebrate him.** Nepal needs leaders like Harka Sampang, not just in Dharan, but across the whole country.

If more leaders followed his example, Nepal wouldn't just change, it would transform.

**Imagine if Harka Sampang’s name was Harka Lamichhane or Harka Sharma, people would’ve already turned him into a national hero by now. But sadly, he’s a Rai… so instead of praise, he gets silence or criticism.**

What are your thoughts? Is caste still limiting how we support good leadership? Why isn’t the media giving him the spotlight he deserves?

EDIT:

After reading all the comments, I realized that around 90% of Nepalese still carry a deep-rooted bias. They’re quick to attack Harka Sampang over trivial things, like what he posts, how he speaks, or who he comments on, yet completely ignore the bigger picture: his bold vision, consistent track record, and tireless work ethic. Instead of supporting someone who’s on the ground every day fighting for clean water, transparency, and justice, they fixate on irrelevant details. One of the most common criticisms is, “What experience does he have?” But compared to what, decades of corrupt politicians who’ve looted the nation? Why do we even ask such foolish questions? If experience means more lies and mismanagement, I’ll take less experience and more integrity any day. Just look at Ronald Reagan, he had no traditional political background, yet became one of the most impactful U.S. Presidents. It’s time we stop judging leaders by outdated standards and start recognizing those who are truly fighting for real change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1k6ub3i/harka_sampang_the_leader_nepal_needs_but_few_are/,4/24/2025 14:57,38,0,260,English,0,1,0,1,0,1
1l17mp9,Anyone here moved back to Nepal for good after living abroad? Would love to hear your experience.,"I’ve been in the US for 9 years now. Came here as a teenager for school and have been working for the past 2 years. I finally got to visit Nepal recently after 7 long years, and honestly it hit me hard. It felt so good to be back. I felt a sense of belonging that I’ve hardly felt here in the US.

Ever since I returned, I’ve been seriously considering moving back to Nepal for good. Life in the US is comfortable but feels mondane and routine. I come from a good family background and there’s a family business doing well back home, so I wouldn’t be starting from zero.

But of course, the political mess, instability, and general uncertainty in Nepal make the decision really tough.

So I wanted to ask— has anyone here actually moved back to Nepal after spending years abroad? What was your experience like? Do you feel it was the right decision?

Would really appreciate hearing some real stories or advice. Thanks in advance!

1i2lq7o,"Did Newars Displace Rai Limbus from Kathmandu?
","**No, Newars did not displace Rai Limbus from Kathmandu.** The claim that Rai and Limbu people were displaced by Newars from Kathmandu Valley is historically inaccurate and baseless. Here’s a detailed explanation that dispels this misconception while tracing the true origins and migration patterns of the Rai and Limbu people.

# 1. Rai and Limbu Origins: Migration from Yunnan, China

The Rai and Limbu communities did not originate in Kathmandu Valley. Instead, they trace their roots to **Yunnan Province, China**, where they were part of the **Yi ethnic group**.

* Historical evidence points to the **Hmong rebellion** in China during the Ming Dynasty (14th-17th centuries) as the primary reason for the displacement of various tribes, including the ancestors of the Rais and Limbus.
* As the Ming Dynasty crushed the rebellion, many Yi groups fled southward and westward into regions like Myanmar, Northeast India, and eastern Nepal.
* These migrants settled in **eastern Nepal**, which later became known as ""Limbuwan,"" after the Limbus. This settlement was far removed from the Kathmandu Valley.

# 2. No Historical Presence of Rais and Limbus in Kathmandu Valley

The Rai and Limbu communities have no historical or archaeological evidence linking them to the Kathmandu Valley. The claims of their connection to the valley or displacement by Newars are unfounded for several reasons:

* The **Kirata dynasty**, which allegedly ruled Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis, was **not associated with the Rais and Limbus**. The identity of the Kiratas aligns more closely with the **Bhils**, an indigenous community of the Indian subcontinent, rather than the Rai or Limbu people.
* Rais and Limbus did not migrate to eastern Nepal from Kathmandu Valley; instead, they came directly from **Yunnan**. Their journey bypassed the central and western regions of Nepal altogether.
* If Rais and Limbus had a prolonged presence in Kathmandu or interaction with its historical societies like the **Licchavis**, **Soma dynasty**, or **Mahispal dynasty**, they would exhibit significant South Asian admixture. Genetic studies, however, show that Rais and Limbus have **almost no South Asian genetic influence**, underscoring their distinct East Asian origins.

# 3. The Mundhum: Evidence of Yunnanese Roots

The **Mundhum**, the oral scripture of the Rai and Limbu people, provides further evidence of their Yunnanese origins:

* The Mundhum lacks any resemblance to the religious texts or oral traditions of the Newars or other communities in Nepal. Instead, it shares striking similarities with the **Meigi oral traditions** of the **Yi tribes** in Yunnan.
* This connection further invalidates any claims that Rais and Limbus were indigenous to Kathmandu or had historical ties to the Kirata dynasty.

# 4. Kirat Identity: The Bhils, Not Rais and Limbus

The **Kirat identity** mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts, such as the *Puranas* and the *Mahabharata*, refers to **indigenous forest-dwelling tribes** of the Indian subcontinent. These tribes were closely integrated into Hindu society.

* The **Bhils**, an indigenous community native to India and Nepal, fit the description of the Kirats far more accurately than the Rais and Limbus.
* The Rais and Limbus, who have **0% South Asian admixture**, could not have been the Kirats described in ancient texts, as the Kirats had significant interactions with Hindu rulers and merchants.
* The association of Rais and Limbus with the Kirat identity is a **modern political construct**, popularized by figures like **Iman Singh Chemjong**, who sought to align the Rai and Limbu communities with the ancient Kirats for political and cultural legitimacy.

# 5. Mercenary Traditions: Yi Tribe vs. Kirats

The mercenary traditions of Rais and Limbus also highlight their **Yunnanese origins**:

* During the **Yuan Dynasty** (Mongol rule in China), the Yi people of Yunnan served as mercenaries for the Mongols. This tradition of military service is mirrored in the history of Rais and Limbus, who later became prominent as mercenaries in the **British Indian Army**.
* The **Kirats**, on the other hand, were jungle-dwelling tribes known for raiding and robbing merchants in ancient Nepal. Their traditions and lifestyle differ significantly from those of the Rais and Limbus.

# 6. The Role of Iman Singh Chemjong

The modern association of Rais and Limbus with the Kirat identity was heavily influenced by **Iman Singh Chemjong**, a Rai scholar and Christian missionary.

* Chemjong’s writings sought to reinterpret the history of Rais and Limbus by aligning them with the Kirats mentioned in ancient Hindu texts.
* In doing so, Chemjong made numerous historical errors, such as claiming that the **Kambojas** (a Punjabi ethnic group) were actually **Khambu Rais**. This claim is laughable and demonstrates a lack of understanding of South Asian history.
* Chemjong also attempted to indigenize the Yunnanese religion of **Bimoism** into the so-called **Kirat religion**, reinventing the Mundhum as an ancient scripture of the Kirats.

# 7. Newars and Their Actual History in Kathmandu

The **Newars** are the indigenous people of Kathmandu Valley, with a rich history that predates the arrival of the Licchavis and other dynasties.

* The Newars were never in conflict with the Rai and Limbu communities because the latter had no historical presence in Kathmandu Valley.
* The Newars developed a unique culture, architecture, and economy in the valley, distinct from the eastern hill tribes like Rais and Limbus.

# 8. Genetic Evidence: No Connection to South Asians

Genetic studies further debunk the claims of Rais and Limbus having ties to the ancient Kirats or Kathmandu Valley:

* Rais and Limbus show **East Asian genetic markers** with no significant South Asian admixture.
* This genetic profile aligns with their migration from **Yunnan** and contrasts with the Kirats described in Sanskrit texts, who had significant interactions with South Asian communities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nepali/comments/1i2lq7o/did_newars_displace_rai_limbus_from_kathmandu/,1/16/2025 10:07,0,0,0,English,0,0,0,0,0,0
1l25n52,Nepal's Visit Visa Scandal: Is Political Shielding Undermining the Fight Against High-Level Corruption and Human Trafficking?,"Nepal's recent visit visa scandal has exposed a disturbing nexus of corruption and human trafficking, but what makes it particularly alarming is the pervasive issue of political shielding, which seems to obstruct genuine accountability.

The scandal revolves around a system where stricter visit visa policies, ostensibly aimed at curbing illegal migration, ironically created a black market. Desperate individuals, unable to meet stringent criteria, were forced to pay exorbitant fees (up to NPR 300,000 for European visas) to a sophisticated network involving immigration officials, travel agents, and allegedly, high-ranking government functionaries. Over 800,000 people traveled abroad on visit visas in the last five years, indicating the scale of this misuse.

**The Core Issue: Political Impunity**

While the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has made arrests, including Immigration Chief Tirtharaj Bhattarai, and uncovered extensive illicit transactions \[Source 1, 3\], the spotlight has quickly turned to political accountability:

* **Accusations Against High Officials:** Reports suggest direct links between the scam and the private secretariat of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, leading to widespread calls for his resignation from opposition parties and even some within his own Nepali Congress
* **Political Shielding:** Despite mounting pressure and his own past statements advocating for ministers to resign when questions are raised, Lekhak has vehemently denied involvement, labeling the accusations as a ""politically motivated smear campaign"". Crucially, the ruling Nepali Congress has publicly shielded him, stating there's ""no evidence"" of his involvement and that ministers shouldn't be held accountable for bureaucratic misconduct. This stance echoes a long-standing pattern where high-ranking officials are rarely prosecuted for complicity in human trafficking crimes, as noted by international reports.
* **Impact on Justice:** This political defense creates a significant barrier to impartial investigation. While junior officers might face consequences, the perceived protection for senior figures undermines public trust in the justice system and allows a culture of impunity to fester. The parliamentary disruptions show the intense political battle over holding power accountable.

The visit visa scandal isn't just about money; it's about vulnerable people being trafficked and a system where political influence allegedly trumps legal consequences. The ongoing battle for accountability in this case will be a litmus test for Nepal's commitment to fighting high-level corruption.

1jrr0cf,Nepal Must Empower Elected Representative,"The current Nepali system, where a non-elected Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) is appointed by the central government to manage municipalities, is deeply flawed. By concentrating power in unelected bureaucrats, this structure undermines local accountability and stifles the authority of democratically elected leaders like mayors and ward chairpersons.

To improve governance, Nepal should adopt models used by major global metropolises:

Empower elected mayors to serve as both political leaders and chief executives (combining the roles of mayor and CAO), ensuring decision-making aligns with public mandates.


Allow mayors to appoint professional city managers (subject to council approval), as seen in council-manager systems, balancing administrative expertise with democratic oversight.


How can we expect results when elected officials—those directly accountable to voters—lack the authority to implement their vision? 

How Top U.S./Canadian Metropolises Operate
United States
Strong-Mayor System (e.g., New York, Chicago): The mayor is both the political leader and chief executive, responsible for budgets, departmental oversight, and executing policy.


Council-Manager System (e.g., Phoenix, San Antonio): The city council sets policy, while a professional city manager, appointed by the council, oversees daily operations.


Canada
Toronto, Montreal, Vancuver: The mayor nominates the city manager, who must then be approved by a majority of city councillors. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1jrr0cf/nepal_must_empower_elected_representative/,4/5/2025 0:26,13,0,3,English,0,0,0,0,0,0

My dad’s been running a manpower recruitment business for over 20 years. Back in the 2010s, it was doing great—one of the top firms in Nepal at its peak, with solid connections in the UAE, especially Dubai. But then COVID hit, and things fell apart. The business hasn’t bounced back since the lockdowns. What started as bank loans turned into borrowing from cooperatives and then informal lenders. Now, most of the monthly income just goes toward paying interest. To keep creditors at bay, my dad even transferred our house paperwork to a trusted friend. We’re getting by, but it’s tough. My old school fees from India are still unpaid, and my younger brother’s school payments are piling up too. We don’t even own a car anymore.
I see my dad grinding every day—going to meetings, reaching out to old contacts, negotiating with creditors—but the hole is deep. He’s not super tech-savvy or up-to-date on modern financial strategies. Looking back, things might’ve been different if he’d restructured the debt during COVID, but that’s in the past now.
As for me, I’m thinking about studying ACCA, maybe even through the University of London route, hoping it could lead to a Master’s or a job abroad someday. But I’m realizing that qualifications alone won’t cut it. Employers want real-world skills, experience, and a strong portfolio. Just getting an ACCA without practical know-how or proving my worth won’t take me far, especially if I’m aiming for opportunities overseas.
My dad still has an office, a smaller team, and decades of business connections, even if cash flow and management are a mess. He’s asked me to start coming to the office, and I’ve been hesitant because, honestly, it feels heavy. But I’m wondering if I should give it a shot. Maybe I could learn how the business runs, take on small tasks, modernize some processes, figure out client coordination, or even dig into how debt works. Maybe I could actually make a difference.
So, I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. Here’s what I’m wondering:
•  Has anyone dealt with a struggling family business while trying to kickstart their own path? How did you manage it?
•  If I want to help my family but also chase a solid education (ideally leading to opportunities abroad), how do I balance those two?
•  Are there specific skills, certifications, or experiences I can pick up locally (or even online) to set me up for finance or business roles down the line?
•  If I start working in the family business, part-time or full-time, what should I focus on to learn the most? Could I even help turn things around or restructure it?
•  For anyone familiar with the recruitment industry or the Dubai labor market, is there still growth potential there? Or should we think about shifting the business model?
•  And to any young people out there carrying the weight of a family legacy while building your own future—how are you making it work?
I know this is a lot, but I had to lay it all out. I’m not here for pity—just looking for practical advice and insights from anyone who’s been through something similar, whether in Nepal or elsewhere. I want to make the next few years count, be smart about my choices, and build skills that matter. My family’s future might depend on it.

1jh2pg1,Is BBA a Good Option for a Middle-Class Student in Nepal?,"

Hi everyone,

I’m a middle-class student in Nepal, and after +2, the only affordable option for me is to study BBA. I initially wanted to pursue BIT or BCA, but my research shows that the IT field is saturated, and the quality of the IT faculty at my nearest college isn’t very reliable. Moreover, I understand that IT is largely a self-learning field—but in 2025, becoming a software engineer in Nepal is extremely challenging due to the weak local IT market. Even foreign-based tech jobs are tough to secure these days, with many layoffs affecting both local and foreign professionals.

On the other hand, I'm really good at communication and have strong explaining skills, which makes BBA a great fit for me. I believe these strengths can open up opportunities in areas like teaching (lecturing or tutoring), government service (loksewa), or banking.

So, what are the real career prospects after a BBA in Nepal? Is it a favorable option for someone with my skills? I’d love to hear your personal experiences and any suggestions you might have.

Thanks in advance for your insights!

1kvo27s,"Looking for 4 other coders in KTM for weekly co-learning cafe meetups (coding, chill, consistent)?","Hey Everyone,

I’m looking to start a small weekly coding co-learning group ( Max 5 people )  that meets every Saturday at a cafe – a focused yet friendly meetup to help each other stay on track, share what we’re working on, and build a habit of consistent learning.

It’s for anyone learning to code – beginners, self-learners, students, or hobbyists. No lectures or formal sessions – just quiet, focused co-working with some friendly vibes.

How it works:

We meet every Saturday (10 AM– 4 PM) at a cafe  

Everyone pays for their own drinks/snacks (we might split if there’s a group cost)

You bring your laptop and code/study on your own stuff

Ask questions, share ideas, or just grind in silence – totally up to you

Capped at 5 people to keep it productive and manageable

Why do this?

- Stay consistent and motivated

- Build local coding connections

- Learn faster with a supportive circle

- Break the coding-alone rut


If you’re interested, DM me here or hit me up on Discord: 
nexus.p_q

Let’s make learning fun and social again – no gatekeeping, just good vibes and shared growth.

1jhwm77,Government Health Insurance Service in Nepal: Protection or Pure Hassle?,"The Health Insurance Board of Nepal provides a government-sponsored health insurance scheme at an annual cost of Rs. 3,500 for a family of five, covering up to Rs. 100,000 in medical expenses. While initially beneficial, particularly for patients with chronic illnesses, the system has faced significant challenges over time.

# Key Issues in the Current Health Insurance System:

* **Increased Cost Sharing:**
   * Initially, medicines included in the insurance scheme were free of charge.
   * Over time, beneficiaries have been required to pay 10% to 20% of their medical expenses.
* **Overburdened Healthcare Facilities:**
   * A rising number of insured individuals has overwhelmed hospitals and clinics.
   * Patients experience excessively long wait times for consultations, prescriptions, and medicines.
   * The referral system for seeking treatment at different hospitals is inefficient and disorganized.
* **Technical and Administrative Failures:**
   * Frequent server outages disrupt the insurance verification process.
   * The approval process for medications is inconsistent—some prescribed dosages are only partially covered, requiring patients to pay for the remaining portion.
* **Patient Experience and Accessibility Issues:**
   * Lengthy queues exist at every stage—from obtaining an OPD card to seeing a doctor and collecting medicines.
   * Even minor check-ups consume an entire day due to inefficiencies in the system.

# Call for Feedback and Suggestions

If you are a beneficiary of Nepal’s Health Insurance Board, what has been your experience?

* What challenges have you encountered?
* What improvements would you suggest in enhancing the effectiveness of the health insurance system?

Your feedback will be appreciated

I have a friend who lives in the USA. During her last visit there, she broke her leg. She was treated by a known doctor, but even after a years, she’s still experiencing issues with her leg.  During her last visit to same doctor the doctor suggested getting another operation. I suggested she consider getting surgery abroad, but she prefers to continue with the same doctor here.

We’re both unsure about what would be the best course of action, and this uncertainty is making me anxious. I don’t mean to offend any medical professionals—I truly respect them. I’m trying to understand what might be the better option in her case.

1k4ervx,Education Minister Bidya Bhattarai has resigned from her position,"Education Minister Bidya Bhattarai has resigned from her position amid ongoing protests by community school teachers demanding the enactment of the School Education Bill. Her resignation is perceived as a result of mounting pressure from the protests and the government's perceived inflexibility in addressing the teachers' demands. While her secretariat cited health reasons for her departure, the timing suggests a connection to the escalating tensions surrounding the education sector. 

The protests have intensified, with teachers refusing to evaluate exam papers and threatening to boycott upcoming examinations until their demands are met.  Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has urged the teachers to return to classrooms, emphasizing the government's willingness to address financially and practically viable demands. 

Minister Bhattarai's resignation adds complexity to the situation, highlighting the challenges faced by the government in resolving the ongoing educational crisis.

-Around baneshwor area as it is accessible to anywhere as my work needs me at different locations(or could be in other place too in ring road area with accessible travel facilities)
-I do have a claustrophobic side so need a bit open/naturally well lit room
-In regards to flatmate, we'll get along well if you chill and respect each other's peace✌🏻 

P.s. I am a guy here helping out a friend. So creeps be warned and anyone interested DM me I'll connect you guys so you can discuss amongst yourselves. Not a big fan of being the middle man but gotta help out in times of need.

1l1eiq9,Where is the remote pay (salary) heading to?,"**Hi there,**

I wanted to share some observations from my experience. I’ve been working remotely for over a year now, and I’ve noticed a concerning trend — the pay culture for remote work is steadily declining.

Companies like **Sakkcha** (owned by a well-known personality), **Sampanna Technologies**, and others are hiring individuals for as low as **AUD 450/month** for administrative roles. Meanwhile, for similar tasks, professionals in the Philippines are being hired at **AUD 900–1000/month**. Why is there such a significant difference?

It raises an important question:  
**Where is the consideration for our additional costs — such as health insurance, provident fund (PF), electricity, internet, and even our personal laptops that we use for work?**

In traditional employment, companies cover these expenses, but in remote contracts, workers are expected to absorb all of them — *yet are paid even less.*

There should be a more fair and structured pay scale for remote roles. For example:

* 0–6 months: AUD 450
* 6–12 months: AUD 800
* 1–2 years: AUD 900+
* and so on.

I came across a post offering ₹30,000 in the first year, ₹45,000 in the second, and ₹50,000 in the third — but that still doesn’t reflect the real value of the work or the real costs we bear.

Let’s not forget: **outsourcing already saves companies a huge amount**. Paying a remote worker AUD/USD 1000 — especially for skilled admin support — should not be seen as a burden. It’s basic fairness.

I urge you to also look into the Filipino remote work market to understand how structured and well-compensated it is in comparison.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kathmandu/comments/1l1eiq9/where_is_the_remote_pay_salary_heading_to/,6/2/2025 10:27,3,0,0,English,0,1,1,0,0,2

1ky9v33,Life of Nepali Politician's Children and Grand children,"Life of Nepali politician's children, grand children and wives have more relax and fabulous lifestyle than stuggling middle class/upper middle class of developed countries.

Would you rather have lifestyle of politician's blood in Nepal or have middle class life in developed Western/Far East Asian countries?

*Politican's children/wives lifestyle

- Travel few countries in a year, 1st class and luxury hotel/resort

- Travel abroad for health issue or no waiting time at all in Nepal

- No need to work hard. No work but self business which they dont need to worry about paying tax.

- They get passed on their education easily without studying hard. Bachelor and degree easily if studying in Nepal when they cannot do better abroad.

- Wives get together almost every day to play games, gambling and busy with fashion/food/films related events at any time they want.

- Youtube, Instra, Social media fans are easily influenced by them on their anything or whatever they do.

- No need to worry about paperworks in Nepali Gov office whereas normal citizens get so much hard time even if they do it properly.

And

*Struggling middle class life abroad

- Need to book holiday in well advance and struggls to get better deals

- Waiting time a lot or need to worry about extra expenses about health issue

- Need to work hard 5/6 days a week and be punctual and have to pay any tax and all

- Need to study really hard and focus on their education even after getting degree

- For any events, wives have to plan in advance or not much time due to work and family care.

- They need to have lot of followers and very good content to keep their social media alive.

And of course there are many.

Conclusion - Politicians have their seats but why their family/relatives are getting everything so easily without contributing like normal citizens? I mean, in other countries, people raise the voice and investigate each and every thing about how they got, how they are given priority or even let go of crime related stuff and even shame them publicly and legally forced them to apologize or pay fine. 

Who fights against these things in Nepal and has any reporter or journalist or any group behind succeeded so far?

I posted this because it was so horrible to see normal Nepali citizens crying out loud in Nepal Gov office when one of the celebrity came in and her paperwork done within 5 mins without waiting in queue. She on her glasses came with someone and straight went to office without waiting as there was queue and they signed and went with ""that someone"" telling her ""tapai ko kaam pura bhayo, hus ma tapai lai bhare call garchu"" a bit loud in front of those people waiting in the queue.

1ixvott,Are Nepali citizens idiot or what I really can't understand? Why are they now begging for monarchy to come back,"For the context, i don't know really that much about politics or been interested in it . I'm just here to give my opinion about this topic.

So I've been hearing this rumor about the return of king gyanendra and the monarchy system and I guess many post has been uploaded in this topic in here, many citizens of Nepal (bheda haru) are supporting it like way hard. Idk if they understand what monarchy system is suru ma ta ane I really don't think they know about the consequences if monarchy came back.  
Now I understand this country is filled with shit corrupted politicians who don't know what they are doing vhnera (no offense but 8 class padeka buda haru xan k aas garnu) and bringing this country slowly to its knees. If the country was developed that much, the youth wouldn't have left this country in search of opportunities.

More on this point tho, So instead of searching for a person who can be a qualified candidate to make a change in our country , our citizen are trying to opt out another way, begging to bring monarchy back (which our people fought for to bring democracy in this country). So i don't understand just why people are believing this shit that monarchy will fix everything that is wrong with this country instead of finding a qualified candidate who can bring a change in this country",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ixvott/are_nepali_citizens_idiot_or_what_i_really_cant/,2/25/2025 14:02,116,0,83,English,1,1,1,0,1,2

1klxjb4,Nepal needs a radical reset. Here's my honest take: (YK - Part 1),"Nepal is stuck in a loop, corruption, caste politics, recycled leaders, and a broken system that doesn’t serve the people. It’s time we talk openly about real change.

We have two options:

# Option 1: Radical Change (Like Maoist Revolution)

A military style uprising, similar to what the Maoists did before, but this time not hijacked by greed or power. It must be rooted in a true national awakening, focused on wiping out caste discrimination, corruption, and elitist politics once and for all.

# Option 2: Elect a Patriot (Like Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew)

We need to rise above party lines and elect a leader who is:

* Clean and corruption-free
* Visionary and disciplined
* Ruthless against injustice, but fair to the people Singapore did it. Rwanda did it. Why not Nepal?

# Let’s be real, Democracy, as imported from the West, doesn’t work for us.

It has become a tool for chaos and corruption. Leaders rotate endlessly like a bad joke. Votes are bought. Promises are empty.

What we need is not this version of ""democracy"" we need a **merit based republic** with strong institutions, strict laws, and long-term vision.

# Here’s what must be abolished immediately:

1. **Caste System** – Still dividing and holding us back in 2025. It’s a social cancer.
2. **Corruption** – From the top to the bottom, it’s everywhere. Jail corrupt politicians, no mercy.
3. **Same PMs on rotation** – How many times will we watch the same 5 people run the country like their personal business?
4. **Party controlled chaos** – Shift towards a presidential system with a fixed term. No horse-trading. No instability every 6 months.

**It’s time to stop pretending everything is fine. Nepal needs a reset, either through radical reform or by electing the right person with the right vision.**

What do you think? Is it time for a new system?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1klxjb4/nepal_needs_a_radical_reset_heres_my_honest_take/,5/13/2025 21:10,16,0,32,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

As for the state of Nepal's economy, and the corruption in politics in the country, what do Nepalis think needs to be done in order to help Nepal develop. I think over the years, most of Nepals development has basically been relative to it's neighbors, and whatever they decide is worth bringing or sharing to Nepal. Outside of that, we haven't seen growth in Nepal's economy in any sectors outside of maybe travel. I know that there is a lot of corruption and issues with bureaucrats, but what can be done? 

It makes me sad to see our country fall behind, and people continuously moving away from it (my family included). Of course I think that due to personal situations and the opportunities abroad, I can't blame anyone from doing so, but I wish that weren't the case.

Its not new habit, they have been using the app for many years now.

Recently, I saw my mother use Hamro-patro for radio/news (not sure) and when she opened, an annoying ad appeared and out of her habit she pressed install. (My mom is not so tech literate to identify ads, so she presses whatever to skip, as with many Nepalese i guess). When i asked her not to do so and checked her phone, there were many such apps installed, which i guess are results of such similar incidents and who even knows what data those apps collect, making me worry about their privacy. i instructed them not to use the app. don't know similar alternatives for now.

I understand that ads are their source of income, but such intrusive and annoying ads every steps of the way and at every visual part, not skippable and some almost 1minute ads (some interactive), has made hamropatro unusable.  i'm not even talking about the stupid bloated features that have been added like payments, chats (don't know who uses them), making users like my parents hard to use the app.

1i78f62,Nepal is falling behind: A rant we all need to hear,"Its hard not to feel frustrated when you look at where Nepal stands today in a world thats racing ahead.The world is pouring billions into advancements like Ai, robotics,and groundbreaking technologies that r reshaping the future.Meanwhile,here we r,stuck in the same cycle of mediocrity and ignorance,as if we r completely blind to the revolution happening around us.

Do people here even realize whats at stake? AI is not just another tech trend its the next industrial revolution.its changing everything,from how businesses operate to how society functions.Yet in Nepal,we r too busy scrolling through shitty tiktoks/reels and chasing  trends to notice. The very people who should be leading this transformation our youth r drowning in mindless entertainment,wasting their potential instead of channeling it into innovation.

And what about the so called “adults”? The boomers and millennials r no better. They r either consumed by endless debates about sahakari kaanda or clinging to political discussions that go absolutely nowhere.its the same tired script blame the system,criticize the leaders, and repeat.Wheres the action? Wheres the vision for a better Nepal?

We r living in a country thats stuck in time. While other nations r moving forward with selfd riving cars,advanced healthcare systems, and AI driven education, we r struggling with corruption scandals. Its like we r satisfied being left behind while the rest of the world evolves.

 we r at the risk of  becoming irrelevant in a world that wont wait for us to catch up.

The revolution is here,and its happening whether we r ready or not.Lets not just sit back and let it pass us by.Its time for a collective mindset shift that prioritizes progress over petty distractions. The future wont wait, and neither should we.

1kpmh90,Why are Nepali songs obsessed with love and nothing else?,"First of all, I’m not talking about folk songs or authentic traditional music. I’m talking about the modern day Nepali artists. 

I’ve been listening to some Nepali music recently, and why is 90% of Nepali music is just about love, breakups and heartache? Do Nepali songwriters think love is the only thing that exists in life? 

Where are the songs about money, ambition, struggle, fame or identity? These are also pretty big parts of life. Why doesn’t our music reflect the real issues and complexities of life in Nepal? 

Our country has gone through stuff like massive labor migration, political instability, civil war, but our mainstream music still sounds like everyone is stuck crying over their ex. 

It makes me wonder if the songwriters haven’t experienced anything else. Is it just laziness or lack of imagination?

Even the artists who clearly made it big and could use their platform to tell stories about everything else, still keep writing the same love songs. It feels like they’re kinda afraid to step out of the bubble because that’s what “sells.”

It is kinda frustrating because Nepal has real problems and stories worth putting into music. But if you judged us based only on our music, you’d think we’re all just hopeless romantic people going through heartbreak 24/7. 

Do you guys feel the same? Or am I just hearing wrong? This is just my opinion, no hard feelings. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1kpmh90/why_are_nepali_songs_obsessed_with_love_and/,5/18/2025 15:22,79,0,41,English,0,1,0,0,0,2
1jis4bi,Why do people ignore me? Struggling with leadership and respect at work.,"I work as an **Officer (Adhikrit) in a Nepal government municipality**, but I feel like people don’t take me seriously. When I ask them to do work, they ignore me or postpone it. In group settings, nobody seems interested in what I say. It feels like my words don’t matter.

I try to be friendly with everyone, including the guards and junior staff. Could this be why they don’t see me as a leader? I don’t know why I struggle to be bold. I want to command respect, but it feels like people don’t care about what I say.

Is this a common issue? What can I do to improve my leadership and presence in a group? Would love to hear advice from people who’ve been in similar situations.

My dad works at a bank on a contract basis, and that contract is about to expire soon. He recently shared this with the family. It’s not like we don’t have other sources of income—we do—but the disappointment I felt in myself at that moment was overwhelming. I wanted to tell him, “I’m here to help,” but I couldn’t.

Being in your 20s keeps reminding me how tough growing up is. Every time something related to money comes up, I wish I could contribute, but I can’t right now because I’m still studying. It’s frustrating, and I know what I’m saying might not make perfect sense, but as you grow up, your priorities shift in ways you don’t expect.

What hurts the most is having to ask my parents for money for things, knowing they already have so much on their plate. It’s a tough feeling to navigate.

All i am trying to say is as a man your first and last priority should be earning or you can say life will force you to make earning your first and final priority

But instead of a conventional biopic im approaching it with sharp wit highlighting the irony between his promises and actions.

like how does a revolutionary turn into the very establishment he fought against? What does his tenure reveal about Nepal’s political system, power dynamics and the shifting perception of leadership? The goal is to make it intellectually engaging while still being accessible something that sparks both thought and laughter.

i see this as a potential Netflix series blending dark humor with historical context similar to Don’t Look Up or The Death of Stalin. Would love to hear thoughts,what aspects of his leadership would you find most interesting or frustrating to explore?

1ijwd6y,So traumatized by others calling me sojho.,"I am writing this seriously and it is really not meant to be funny.  I grew up in a 'sojho' household where everyone was sojho and introverted. I went to school and yes I didn't have a 'great' experience. I have always been an introvert, however as I grew up and with internet I did learn about various nuances of communication, being assertive , funny and such things. As I began to focus on developing my social skills, yes I did improve quite a lot. I had girls talking to me, showing interest in me, many people respecting me , being life of the party and so on. And MANY STILL do. Like I am not the previous guy who couldn't stand up for himself etc. And I am very very far from someone who always sees good in others. In fact I despise a lot of people,  and am not afraid telling them that to their face when necessary.

But my problem is, STILL sometimes for some reason that I have no control over, I get disrespected by being called sojho. And when that happens, I usually am assertive with such people. Indirectly putting them in their place. ( As directly saying - Malai sojo vanchas! Would reinforce the idea that I am sojo).  But that is not always feasable, as my own relatives who help me, often disrespect me by saying that.

I am quite frustrated that I have really no control over this area. I feel lack of control. I also have a minor mental illness, literally. But Despite all my efforts to appear cool , respected etc, some chutiya people for some reason 'sense' that I am sojo and act in a weird way towards me.

I know that some of you might say - it's a fool's errand to try to make everyone happy. I agree. But I can see that for me it's different. I 'feel' weird and isolated sometimes which MANY MANY people don't. NO matter where I go, atleast in Nepal I will encounter people who will look down upon me AS sojho. If you talk about my family, then  we ARE still looked down upon as sojho by other relatives.

Note, for about 80% people I am cool with them and this is something that doesn't happen that often. But many people, even WITH GOOD INTENTION call me sojho which I am not happy with.  Do I shy from conflict with them? No. Unless I have something to gain from them. But still I feel kinda isolated, left out , not included. And I feel sad that I still didn't have the  social skills to prevent this from happening.

And you know the saddest part? I  feel happy that I will leave Nepal and Nepal's culture of not liking - honest, blunt, upfront people and branding them as sojho. There is no equivalent toxic concept of sojho in the west (One gullible vai was saying - sojho means naive , dumb , spineless. A SOJO VAI ! Timley kitab ma padheko jasto Kura teti simple chaina yar! ) . So think about this - A WIDE RANGE personalities in Nepal are looked down upon as sojho. WIDE. Introverted , Honest, Not assertive , Not caring about others , , Not conniving, Not being funny , Not confrontational, obedient, the list goes on and on. Notice that those are not mutually  exclusive. A person can be Honest yet assertive (sojo). Pure hearted yet funny (sojo), Calculating but doesn't talk much (Sojo) . Confrontational yet obedient (sojo). So a wide range of people will be looked down up as sojho.

But why look down upon them? Why not simply like them and let them feel included?  
In my case - It likely stems from - me not talking with people that much , or don't overtly start to tease others unless I am interested in them. (Malai ta sita bolna manchaina, interest lagena vandaima ma sojo vaye? It also doesn't mean I don't like you. It simply means I am not interested.) But that doesn't mean someone should look down upon me as naive. I am tired of unfriending many people and taking revenge on them, being in conflict with them although I didn't mean to. Have lost many friends that way. Its like Nepali culture , and me ( a Nepali!) have SO much difference. Atleast against about 20% of people. It's like Nepal itself is a foreign country to me in a foreign culture, where I cannot adjust no matter how much I try, although I have been here all my life!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1ijwd6y/so_traumatized_by_others_calling_me_sojho/,2/7/2025 14:35,34,0,44,English,0,1,1,0,1,2

No, I wasn’t on a boat. I was literally in a regular bus on a regular road, but Maps confidently placed me floating in the water like I was canoeing my way to my destination.

It’s incredibly frustrating how unreliable Google Maps can be in parts of Nepal. Roads are often missing, locations are misplaced, and sometimes it’ll even direct you through terrain that's not motorable — unless you're on a yak or a drone.

I get that remote areas are harder to map accurately, but this was on a major route near a city. It’s 2025, and we still can't get basic GPS tracking right here?

1jd7wk8,Are things really materialized into genders? My uncle’s view on bikes and scooters made me question it.," So, the other day, my parents and two uncles were talking about vehicles. As a bike enthusiast, I excitedly mentioned how much I wanted to get a bike. The conversation was going great until my Uncle A decided to jump in and turn it into something I wasn’t expecting.

As soon as I expressed my interest in riding a bike, Uncle A started talking about how “women” should only ride scooters because bikes are too dangerous and “manly.” He went on to say that scooters were more “appropriate” for women, while bikes were meant for men. It made me stop and think—why are these things so materialized into gender roles? Why is it that bikes are considered a “male” thing, and scooters are somehow considered a “female” thing?

It was honestly frustrating because I’m a female and just 4'11"" tall, and I’ve always had a passion for bikes. My size has never deterred me from my interest. But there he was, trying to impose this outdated stereotype based on something as simple as the kind of vehicle you choose to ride. His view felt so limiting and narrow-minded.

Thankfully, my dad was quick to back me up. He told Uncle A that gender has no place in deciding what kind of vehicle anyone should ride. I really appreciated my dad stepping in, especially when it felt like the conversation was turning into a gendered debate over something that should be about personal interest, not outdated norms.

Has anyone else had moments like this where people try to materialize interests or passions into gender roles? I’m curious if this happens often or if it's just me overthinking it!

We live in a neighborhood where the road is already very narrow, and on top of that, multiple neighbors are parking their bikes all over the place, making it nearly impossible to move around. To make matters worse, some houses are under construction, and they’ve dumped piles of sand, stone, and bricks right on the road.

My family is the only one with cars, and we need to take them out frequently, but every time, it turns into a whole ordeal. We either have to struggle to squeeze through, move bikes ourselves, or wait for someone to clear the way. It’s a constant headache, and honestly, I’m getting tired of it.

I’ve tried talking to some of them, but they either don’t take it seriously or just say, “There’s no other place to park.” But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a public road, not their personal parking lot. The construction mess has made things even worse, and now the road is just a total disaster.

I’m considering filing a complaint, but I’m not sure where to start. Should I go to the ward office, municipality, or traffic police? Or is there another way to get them to stop blocking the road?

I had blocked her debit card from mobile banking last year when they deducted the same charge. She doesn’t use the card and hasn’t even received the ATM, so I didn’t bother to contact the bank back then. I just blocked it through mobile banking, thinking it was enough and the charges would stop.

But when the charge was deducted again this time, I called Siddhartha Bank’s customer care (which is honestly the worst), and they told me the card was only temporarily blocked.

Nowhere in the app does it clearly mention that. They should be upfront about something so important. Instead of giving a proper explanation, they kept going in circles with different excuses and steps. No one owned up to the issue.

The most frustrating part? My mom didn’t even go to the bank to open the account. The staff came to our shop when I wasn’t there and convinced her to open an account and set up a QR code, which she agreed to—but she never asked for an ATM card.

I’m looking to shift to a **1BHK or 2BK flat**, somewhere nearby. Budget: **15–16K max**. I don’t want anything fancy, just basic decency:

✅ **Personal bathroom**  
✅ **Running water** (doesn’t have to be 24/7, but not zero either)  
✅ **Privacy**

My office is in **Baneshwor**, so ideally I don't want to move too far out. I don’t have a private vehicle, so I rely on public transport. That's the only reason I want to stay within reasonable distance.

Tried contacting some agents; paid 500-500-500 just to be shown rooms that are either haunted-looking, have no doors, or are just plain trash.

I know I’m middle-class and I’m not expecting luxury, but why is everything in KTM so overpriced for what they offer?

If anyone has any leads, ideas on **how to search**, **whom to contact**, or **good areas** within my range – please help.  
Even tips on trusted agents or Facebook groups would be appreciated.

Thanks a lot in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1kllo3v/need_help_finding_a_decent_flat_stuck_in/,5/13/2025 13:16,5,0,5,English,1,1,1,0,1,2
1i44dgz,some people in agency's are really dumb,"I (18f) am currently working as an intern for an office and we had like a partnership with another office. Now there's this one guy who's probably like over 28 year old. He was absolutely disrespectful from the start. I am an intern and I just work as what my boss tells me to and he had to contact me before contacting with my director (pretty obvious). But he always used to call my boss on the tinest things too and also if I had said anything to him. He would call my boss and tell it to him.Everything even things like ""Please wait for a bit"" which is pretty annoying if I have to say because my boss told me to handle it all and he keeps complaining the smallest stuffs to him.My boss is a busy man so of course he will not be replying every little whining of this stupid guy. 

Fast-forward to yesterday, He was literally acting crazy. We had a IT problem in a server that led to some documents being seen as not submitted and this guy had the audacity to cuss us out without even trying to understand the situation.

Yesterday I had taken a leave in office as I had some personal works to do. Though, in the morning this guy was asking me to help him for such a simple work which I had gave the instructions like weeks ago, legit weeks ago. Well ""I'm supposed to be respectful"" I thought and I asked him to prepare few documents (literally took him 4 hours). I went outside and I didnt see his texts because I was off work yesterday. I saw his message like around night time and still  he hadn't send the complete documents (wth). It's literally not even working hours plus I wasn't supposed to work today because I was busy entertaining some guests at that time. Later, after around 30 mins or so. I was called by my boss. I  answered him quickly. He told me to look at the group's chat. I look at it. And wow. This disrespectful guy had just cussed us and called my boss ""Pathetic"" and  You know what? The server that was being updated by the IT team (which we literally gave announcement about) he send us a picture of it and says that "" you can tell me if you dont want to work"" and ""it's really pathetic"".

This guy. First of all it's not the problem from our side. Second of all, we have already gave announcement about this to everyone again and again. He didnt even see the announcements and now was pulling out bullshit saying how we dont wanna work?? Isn't it absolutely his fault?. My boss was really furious. Like people normally would at least try to understand the situation and say why this was happening or so. But no..That childish so called guy had the audacity to cuss us out? Like we aren't even the one to handle the servers. We just give instructions to people. It's so obvious and it was already told before handed. Have some freaking brain cells man. Gosh I am still pissed at the guy. It literally wasnt even our fault. What can we even do about it..Like we have told you already and yet you still act like a brat. More than that I am literally almost 10 years younger than this dude. He literally tried to tell us off on some really stupid shit. It just frustrates me very much. I don't.know how people like this even get jobs. At least have some basic etiquette man. This is just ridiculous in every way. My boss has told me not to contact the guy any more. I hope I will never meet such a stupid yet arrogant and childish person ever in my life. 

I dont know I cant call on him because it might just seem as us finding excuses to him. But then again, Who does he think he is tho? Why does He wants to order us around? Way off stupid.We don't really know what will happen. At least we will definitely not work with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1i44dgz/some_people_in_agencys_are_really_dumb/,1/18/2025 9:57,0,0,21,English,0,1,0,0,1,2

I'm not necessarily talking about inventing the next Facebook, but more along the lines of:
""I wish someone could just [do X tedious online task] for me every week/month.""
""I'd pay for a simple online tool or service that helps me consistently with [Y specific frustration].""

1ix13el,Can you visualize scenes while reading?,"

I can’t seem to visualize anything when I read novels or other texts, and it’s really ruining my experience. I’m wondering if this is common or if I’m just overthinking it. When I try really hard to imagine the scenes, I get frustrated, and my heart starts beating fast.

Does anyone else experience this?

1i7xn6x,Where can i buy bubble wrap on Kathmandu?,"I need to bubble wrap some glass jars for a long international flight, but I’m having a hard time finding bubble wrap here in Kathmandu, Nepal. I’ve called a couple of so-called packaging shops in the area, but none of them seem to carry it. It’s frustrating because back in the US, bubble wrap is super easy to find—almost every packaging store, including big retailers like Walmart, stocks it.  

I’m starting to worry because I need to make sure these jars are well-protected for the journey. Has anyone here been in a similar situation, especially in Kathmandu or other places where bubble wrap isn’t as readily available? Are there any alternative materials or methods I could use to safely pack these jars? Or does anyone know of a specific store in Kathmandu that might sell bubble wrap?  

Any tips, hacks, or leads would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1i7xn6x/where_can_i_buy_bubble_wrap_on_kathmandu/,1/23/2025 6:53,5,0,4,English,1,0,1,0,0,2
1ifazoh,"Is it an standard practice in Nepal and its companies to hold out on TDS, SSF, PF or any other benefits?","I’ve noticed a **worrying trend**—companies delaying or outright **not depositing employees’ TDS (Tax Deducted at Source), Social Security Fund (SSF), or Provident Fund (PF) contributions**, or any other contributions. In some cases, this has gone on for **years**, causing **financial and legal issues** for employees, and surprisingly happens on any sector of business.

Many of us receive **salary slips showing deductions** for TDS, SSF, and PF, but when we check with the tax office or SSF portal, **the amounts were never deposited.** After asking around, I found that in many companies, **SSF or PF are only deposited when an employee resigns, and even then, only if they explicitly request it.** This means:

🚨 **Loss of interest** on PF and SSF contributions

🚨 **Potential tax liabilities and inability to take out loans from banks** because TDS records are incomplete

🚨 **Financial instability** when salary disbursement is delayed **on top of this**

🚨 **Employees being forced to chase their own money** when leaving a company

Some companies argue that they are having financial problems within the company, the company is going in loss, the company will shut down, but let’s be real—that’s **NOT our problem**. If they’re deducting from our salary, they have a **legal and moral responsibility** to deposit it on time.

So, I want to ask:

➡️ **Is this a common practice in Nepal?** Do most companies do this, or is it just a few bad actors?

➡️ **Has anyone successfully forced their employer to clear these payments?** If so, how?

➡️ **What legal actions** can employees take if a company continuously fails to deposit TDS, SSF, PF, or other mandatory deductions?

➡️ **Can the company just close and never pay out anything or will they still be liable?**

It’s frustrating that employees have to **fight just to get what they rightfully earned**. Would love to hear from others dealing with similar issues, and what can we do about it?

1hx4bou,Airline Tickets Refund Issue,"I booked a Shree airlines flight at dec 7 biratnagar - Kathmandu. It got cancelled due to poor weather conditions. It was my first flight cancellation experience. The staff claimed that the refund would take 5-7 days for refund if the ticket purchase was made via payment methods other than wallets like esewa, khalti etc. 

I bought ticket via the airline's app. For payment, i used ConnectIps with my linked bank account. Specifically, Sanima bank. I waited and when it took more than the days claimed, i phoned Shree airlines Customer support and asked about refund. They claimed they that had processed the refund the very day after cancellation. Also they provided screenshots of the system whicb is attached in this post. I recalled multiple times, the response was same. One of the call addressed me to reach bank.

 25-Dec, I phone called my bank branch. They said they have forwarded the refund issue to higher-ups and asked me to wait for next 3-4 days for refund. Days passed, i reached my bank branch at Dec 31. I reported my issue. The staff asked me to write an application letter to appeal for refund. I controlled my frustration in hope of refund. I wrote and the staff assured me, it woul take next 3-4 days. I waited. the days exceeded. I phone called. It seems the application has not been processed yet. It's Dec 9.
